They do not!
They do to!
I hope so.
She okay?
Let's go.
Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
I'm kidding. You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"? And you don't know how to quit?
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
The "real you".
What good stuff?
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
Thank God! If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
Me. This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
What crap?
do you listen to this crap?
Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."
You always been this selfish?
Then that's all you had to say.
Well, no...
You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
I was?
I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
Have fun tonight?
I believe we share an art instructor
You know Chastity?
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
Who knows? All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Lesbian? No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
She's not a...
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't. Not unless my sister goes.
Sure have.
Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
How do you get your hair to look like that?
You're sweet.
You have my word. As a gentleman
I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
You got something on your mind?
Well, there's someone I think might be --
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
Forget French.
That's because it's such a nice one.
Right. See? You're ready for the quiz.
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
Let me see what I can do.
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
That's a shame.
Unsolved mystery. She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser. My sister. I can't date until she does.
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
Forget it.
You're asking me out. That's so cute. What's your name again?
Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine. Saturday? Night?
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part. Please.
Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Can we make this quick? Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad. Again.
I did.
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
I don't have to be home 'til two.
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
Combination. I don't know -- I thought he'd be different. More of a gentleman...
Is he oily or dry?
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
Where did he go? He was just here.
You might wanna think about it
Did you change your hair?
You know the deal. I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
Hi, Joey.
Hey, sweet cheeks.
My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
Queen Harry?
Exactly So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
It's more
Patrick -- is that- a.
It's just you.
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
No! I just wanted
What? To completely damage me? To send me to therapy forever? What?
I just wanted --
You set me up.
Let go!
So did you
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
I guess I'll never know, will I?
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
That's not
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
Why didn't you tell me?
Just once. Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore. I wasn't ready. He got pissed. Then he broke up with me.
You did what?
He said everyone was doing it. So I did it.
As in...
Now I do. Back then, was a different story.
But you hate Joey
He was, like, a total babe
In 9th. For a month
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
Like you care.
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
You're welcome.
I don't get you. You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
Can we go now?
You are so completely unbalanced.
Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend. I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
It's Shakespeare. Maybe you've heard of him?
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
What's normal?
You're ruining my life' Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.
I think you're a freak. I think you do this to torture me. And I think you suck.
What do you think?
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
Can you at least start wearing a bra?
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
Where've you been?
I have a date, Daddy. And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
I'm missing something.
Fine. I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house. I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
You're not going unless your sister goes. End of story.
He's not a "hot rod". Whatever that is.
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
No, but
The prom? Kat has a date?
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
Because she'll scare them away.
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
Just for a minute
Daddy, no!
Wear the belly before you go.
It's just a party. Daddy.
Oh, God. It's starting.
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn't going --
Otherwise known as an orgy?
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
And where're you going?
Daddy, I --
Exactly my point
But she doesn't want to date.
But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!
Then neither will you. And I'll get to sleep at night.
What if she never starts dating?
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating. End of discussion.
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
Just sent 'em through.
Padua girls. One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
Fan of a fan. You see a couple of minors come in?
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan. Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
Always a pleasure, Brucie.
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
No, I ' m not.
Buttholus extremus. But hey, you're making progress.
The hell is that? What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
You told me that part already.
It's her favorite band.
Assail your ears for one night.
Okay! I wasn't sure
He's pretty!
Dead at forty-one.
Her favorite uncle
It's a lung cancer issue
Number one. She hates smokers
Are you kidding? He'll piss himself with joy. He's the ultimate kiss ass.
Will Bogey get bent?
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
This is it. A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
You got him involved?
Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
I thought you hated those people.
You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set. You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list. With me by your side.
That's what I just said
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
Forget his reputation. Do you think we've got a plan or not?
I'm serious, man, he's whacked. He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
No kidding. He's a criminal. I heard he lit a state trooper on fire. He just got out of Alcatraz...
He seems like he thrives on danger
What makes you think he'll do it?
You wanna go out with him?
What about him?
Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you. So what's the point?
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
That's her? Bianca's sister?
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
You could consecrate with her, my friend.
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
You know French?
He always have that shit-eating grin?
Because they're bred to. Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter. She's not allowed to date until her older sister does. And that's an impossibility.
Why not?
Bianca Stratford. Sophomore. Don't even think about it
Who is she?
You burn, you pine, you perish?
That girl -- I --
Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse. They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
That I'm used to.
Couple thousand. Most of them evil
How many people go here?
Get out!
How many people were in your old school?
Yeah. A couple. We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
I was kidding. People actually live there?
North, actually. How'd you ?
So -- which Dakota you from?
C'mon. I'm supposed to give you the tour.
So they tell me...
You the new guy?
You get the girl.
What's the worst?
She kissed me.
You makin' any headway?
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns . That's a direct quote
I don ' t know. I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
What'd you do to her?
Then, go get her
Cameron -- do you like the girl?
She's partial to Joey, not me
What 're you talking about?
It's off. The whole thing.
Cameron, I'm a little busy
Don't make me do it, man
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
Okay -- Likes: Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".
I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
What've you got for me?
Yeah -- we'll see.
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
And why would I do that?
Leave my sister alone.
Your sister here?
Where ya goin?
Not at all
Hey -- do you mind?
They're running the rest of me next month.
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow. Tough break.
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers. Another hundred for the tux --
Get her to act like a human
Do what?
How'd you do it?
A deal's a deal.
It's about time.
Forget her sister, then.
Forget it.
A hundred bucks a date.
I just upped my price
I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
I'm on it
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.
Fifty, and you've got your man.
Take it or leave it. This isn't a negotiation.
Fine, thirty.
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
How much?
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend. And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
You got it, Verona. I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
You need money to take a girl out
You just said
Sure, Sparky. I'll get right on it.
Yeah, whatever. I want you to go out with her.
Two legs, nice rack...
What do you think?
Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
You better not fuck this up. I'm heavily invested.
What? We took bathes together when we were kids.
You and Verona?
Uh, yeah. We're old friend*
I hear you're helpin' Verona.
So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her. Someone who's up for the job.
Does this conversation have a purpose?
But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?
We're not.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you. You know, just to see if you're interested.
We don't chat.
Nope - just came by to chat
Are you lost?
Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
William - he asked me to meet him here.
Have you seen him?
Oh, good. Something new and different for us.
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective. We're making a statement.
Okay, okay, we won't go. It's not like I have a dress anyway
Listen to you! You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
Can you even imagine? Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
I got drunk. I puked. I got rejected. It was big fun.
You didn't
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
You didn't have a choice? Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
I didn't have a choice.
You went to the party? I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
Who cares?
What'd he say?
No fear.
You think this'll work?
If I was Bianca, it would be, "Any school you want, precious. Don't forget your tiara."
Does it matter?
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming. Do you mind?
Neither has his heterosexuality.
That's never been proven
William didn't even go to high school
William would never have gone to a state school.
You could always go with me. I'm sure William has some friends.
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
An attempted slit.
What's this?
Just a little.
Mandella, eat. Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.
Block E?
He always look so
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
Patrick Verona Random skid.
Who's that?
Don ' t you even dare. . .
Oh, Bianca? Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
Because I like to torture you.
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
Is that right?
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
I didn't care about the money.
Really? What was it like? A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
It wasn't like that.
You were paid to take me out! By -- the one person I truly hate. I knew it was a set-up!
Wait I...
It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
That ' s completely adorable!
My grandmother's .
Look, I'm -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives. I was wrong.
Oh huh
It's just something I had. You know
It's Scurvy's. His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
Nothing! There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
Answer the question, Patrick
You need therapy. Has anyone ever told you that?
You tell me.
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
Create a little drama? Start a new rumor? What?
Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
Why not?
No, I won't go with you
No what?
You know what I mean
Is that a request or a command?
Go to the prom with me
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
No one else knows
You're sweet. And sexy. And completely hot for me.
No -- something real. Something no one else knows.
I hate peas.
Tell me something true.
I know the porn career's a lie.
The duck?
State trooper?
For. . . ?
You up for it?
You never disappointed me.
Then you screwed up
Something like that
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
Acting the way we do.
So what's your excuse?
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
A soft side? Who knew?
I dazzled him with my wit
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
Good call.
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect. And piss you off.
The Partridge Family?
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
Forget it. I'm stayin'.
Put your right foot there --
Try lookin' at it from this angle
C'mon. It's not that bad
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
Look up, sunshine
He left! I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
So what did I have an effect on ?
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
Unwelcome? I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
You 're so --
I heard there was a poetry reading.
What are you doing here?
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique? I lost my copy.
No offense, but you're sister is without. I know everyone likes her and all, but ...
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
So what ' s up with your dad? He a pain in the ass?
I'm gettin' there
Oh, so now you think you know me?
You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
My father wouldn't approve of that that
Start a band?
Do what?
I should do this.
Why'd you lie?
Then why'd you ask?
No, you weren't
Were you in jail?
When you were gone last year -- where were you?
But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them. I saw you there.
And I'm in control of it.
Kat! Wake up!
You know what they say
I thought you were above all that
Hey man. . . You don ' t think I can be "cool"? You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
I know. It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
I hate him.
Why'd you let him get to you?
Just let me sit down.
See that? Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Like you could find one
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Sure, I do
You don't care if I die
I told you
Why 're you doing this?
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
This is so patronizing.
I know, just let me sleep
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
I just need to lie down for awhile
You're not okay.
I'm fine. I'm
Funny, you're the only one
I say, do what you wanna do.
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
What's this?
Why, don't you?
You know who The Raincoats are?
You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there.
Do you mind? You're sort of ruining it for me.
That's what you want, isn't it?
Excuse me?
hey. Great show, huh?
Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
You're not a big talker, are you?
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
Are you following me?
You -- covered in my vomit.
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
And why would I do that?
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
You hate me don't you?
I know a lot more than that
Like where? The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
The night I take you to places you've never been before. And back.
Oh, right. Friday.
Pick you up Friday, then
My mission in life.
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
Sweating like a pig, actually. And yourself?
I mean Wo-man. How ya doin'?
Oh, Christ. Don't tell me you've changed your mind. I already sent 'em a check.
When I go?
No -- impressed.
What's the matter? Upset that I rubbed off on her?
Bianca did what?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Which parts?
Parts of it.
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
No, Daddy.
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food. Is this something I should be hip to?
Yeah. She left with some bikers Big ones. Full of sperm.
Was that your sister?
I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices. I want --
You're eighteen. You don't know what you want. You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
So what I want doesn't matter?
As a parent, that's my right
Because you're making decisions for me.
Why can't we agree on this?
I thought you were punishing me.
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
Then tell them I had a seizure.
My insurance does not cover PMS
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
You decided.
I thought we decided you were going to school here. At U of 0.
I know.
Just smack her now.
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now? Or do I have some time to think about it?
No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls. I was merely a spectator.
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
Katarina Stratford. My, my. You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
Kat a fan, too?
Macbeth, right?
Oh yeah.
You think?
Yeah. I guess.
Cool pictures. You a fan?
Hey there. Tired of breathing?
Man -- don't say shit like that to me. People can hear you.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
You were right. She's still pissed.
No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
So you got cozy with she who stings?
I'm likin' you guys better
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
Ever been to Club Skunk?
Just for now.
Are you telling me I'm a - "non-smoker"?
Good enough.
We're your guys.
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture. Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.
So Dorsey can get the girl?
That's where we can help you. With Kat.
Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure. Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.
What is it with this chick? She have three tits?
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
What plan?
Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
Say it
See you next week!
You're completely demented.
Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
What's to discuss?
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
I'm at a loss, then. What should we talk about? Your year of absence?
Touch of the flu.
I don't understand, Patrick. You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?
With the teeth of your zipper?
It was a bratwurst. I was eating lunch.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
I missed you.
That ' s what I thought
Absolutely not.
Did I have anything to say about it?
Your daughters went to the prom.
What just happened?
But -- who -- what --?
Have a great time, honey!
Dr. Ruth?
What do you wanna watch? We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
Kissing? Is that what you think happens? Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home. Let her go.
Pirate -- no question.
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
You're not helping.
Jesus! Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
What's a synonym for throbbing?
Make anyone cry today?
In the microwave.
Can't be that far, I say. Also, I don't like the smell of the sea around here. Smells like a cunt. Bad sign...
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
We should have seen land.
We'll all go crazy...
He's the devil's child...
With a face like that? I don't want you looking at me. You hear?
Ah, leave him alone. He's doing no harm.
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...! Bastard!
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
I never seen heat like this! Not even in Las Minas!
Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.
Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
No. The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people. I, too, will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God.
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
If they agree to follow me, yes.
Your life, and that of others!
Excellency, you are right.
Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately... 22,000 leagues or more. Which makes the ocean... uncrossable.
I am, Your Eminence
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ... Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle? Erathostene? Ptolemeus?
Yes, your Eminence. The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
A waste...? Let me tell you something, Arojaz. If your name, or mine, is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his.
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
You can see for yourself.
On the contrary, Your Eminence. It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
He is a mercenary! Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
Naturally. But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
The Judgment is ours!
The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...
I can't keep my eyes off you. I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
What is it, now? Tell me...
I am busy inside.
Can't you stay with us a little?
Not everything... Do you think I care? I'm a free man again. Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
They took everything...
They tried... but I didn't let them.
God... you're so beautiful! I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
You don't usually ask.
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
That's something you can't decide.
I don't want you to wait for me.
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
Thank God...
She said yes.
I find that hard to believe.
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
I'd love to argue with you sometimes. But you're never here!
Are we going to argue?
Well... that's true. I have a child by a man who won't marry me! Who's always leaving...
I haven't given you much of a life.
I know.
I could be gone for years.
I am afraid this is not the worst news.
How could I be? The mainland has been found. Exactly as I said it would.
I am not a seaman. But I heard it is no more than a week at sea. I hope you are not too disappointed.
How far from here?
Congratulations. Then I am free to search for the mainland.
Viceroy of the West Indies.
Appointment to what?
My letters of appointment.
Yes... I remember...
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
May I ask by whom?
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands? Is it not so?
Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
Really? God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father. From the beginning. Everything.
He never had one... except aboard my ships!
He asks when he can come to visit you. He left his address.
What does he say?
I am not listening, Father. But I can't help hearing.
What are you listening to?
There must be a passage to that other ocean.
Not bad.
How are you feeling, Fernando?
This time with me!
I have to explore the mainland.
Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
You promise? Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
There'll be a time.
I want to go with you!
All of them created by people like me.
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
What do you see?
Look out of that window.
I am not afraid of you. You are nothing but a dreamer.
Call them.
All I have to do is call the guards.
To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation. A little hypocrisy goes a long way.
What...? Do I have so many already?
You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
Good! We are also in need of judges. Except there are no thieves!
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
... for a commoner?
You defend yourself admirably...
Forgive me, Don Colon. But what about gold?
If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
And were you never ambitious, Excellency? Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
Then you are too ambitious.
I'm not bargaining!
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
You never learned how to speak my language.
Utapan, won't you speak to me? You used to know how to speak to me.
You did the same to your God!
You have to find them, Utapan. Look what they did!
Ask him if he will help.
He understands.
We will work with his people. We want peace. Ask the Chief if he understands?
He has medicine. Tell him we admire his people.
Chief says...
... and also to bring medicine.
Chief says -- he has a God.
To bring the word of God.
Chief says -- how many?
Tell him his country is very beautiful. Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
Chief knows.
Tell the Chief we thank him.
You come! You speak first!
Island. Far.
What is it? A tribe? An island?
Say not here! Cuba!
I don't know... I have the impression that I didn't change that much. I still can't accept the world as it is!
Oh? So you are a new man?
New worlds create new people.
I knew you would.
I have to disagree.
You'll always be older than me, Father.
I suppose we're both old men now.
Give me absolution.
I believed in you...
You are bound by an oath, Father.
My son, my son... Your certitudes are sometimes frightening... Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
If I tell them, they won't follow me. You know that I am right, Father. You trust me...
May God forgive you...! You must tell them! You must tell your men!
I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
How long?
I lied. The journey will be longer than I said.
What are you saying?
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men. And I betrayed you.
I am listening, my son.
Forgive me, Father. For I have sinned.
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
Colon! Don't!
All of them! Just lies!
Damn God!
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
Wait! I've waited seven years already! How much longer do you want me to wait?
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
Passion is something one cannot control!
Father Marchena!
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man. Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
So was Christ!
Esdras is a Jew.
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
How can you be so certain?
Ignorance! I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
How can you be so certain? The Ocean is said to be infinite.
To open a new route to Asia. At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
Why do you wish to sail west?
With some difficulty. I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
How did you manage it?
That's what it says.
God... That's in a week!
Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him. And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon. Even brothers from different mothers...
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
Thank you.
But without your brothers. Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies. You may explore the continent.
They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
Do they have such thoughts?
Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
How old are you, Senor Colon?
A woman?
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
May I speak freely?
Surely you can do anything you want.
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
That she was impregnable.
What did they say about Granada before today?
The ocean is uncrossable?
No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
You will regret this.
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
You did not hear me, Don Colon. Not my horse.
Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
My horse doesn't work.
We can't raise the wheel without it.
We don't need to know.
You want a war? Fine. We are a thousand. They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill? Which tribe?
If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
We lost cousins, friends. We will wash this in blood.
The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God! I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
We can't be.
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
What's he doing?
Twenty eight.
What do you read?
Come over here.
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is! But I've never seen it used at night before.
And what do you think Mendez?
Well... It's the men, Sir. They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...
God be with us admiral.
Due west, Captain Mendez. And may God be with us...
You're right. Let the men decide.
You tell that to them!
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward! Think about that!
You bloody...
You never did. You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
Jesus Maria! I should have never listened to you!
And then what? Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
You don't know anything! Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
The land is there. I know it!
We're lost!
You think I don't know that?
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
You must be mad...!
Six days ago, yes.
You lied! You cheated! We're way past 750 leagues!
Where can I meet this man?
Because he is not afraid of me.
Then why?
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
And who would you think of, for such a task?
He must be replaced.
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
Is this true, Brother Buyl?
... But there is worse. He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we? We must have faith. We must give time for time.
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying. But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.
Yes. It would be a pity, wouldn't it? Call him back!
... Into a monk...
Never, Your Majesty. Although...
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!
...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...
I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
I'm abused. Don't you think?
Can I see your back?
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
That's what he did to me. He put cigarettes out on me.
Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born. Put it out. Can you put the cigarette out?
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind. And my father blamed me for her blindness...
Back in the Czech Republic?
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
Your mother was blind?
My father always degraded me. Killed my self-esteem. And my mother was blind.
Tell me about yourself. What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
Give me another one, please.
I need to know about your background. I need to know about your upbringing. Why you're here.
What else do you need?
This is not about money, Emil. I need your trust in me.
But it's...
No. No way.
I would say...half. Half is fair.
What's your cut? How much?
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
What about my movie rights? Book rights?
Don't worry about him. Think about yourself.
No, he is here. Shit...
Disappeared. They're looking everywhere. Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
What about Oleg?
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently. No question about that.
I was all of these.
...delusions and paranoia.
Oh, sure.
You bring the cigarettes?
I brought you some letters. It's really fan mail. Women mostly. One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.
I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel. I'm coming with him.
Yes. Yes, come with me!
I'm coming with you.
Where are we going?
Don't say anything.
He has the camera! He took the movie!
Emil. Take it easy. Stay with me. Sit down. What do you need? What are you looking for?
Oh no! No! Shit!
Here. I have your money.
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Are you my attorney? I'm Emil. I'm insane.
Daphne, I...
I don't want to drag you down with me.
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
Forget about me. You have enough problems of your own.
Pouring it out!
What are you doing?
I'll get my clothes.
I'll make some for us.
In the kitchen.
Do you have coffee?
You better get packed.
I'm glad I met you.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process. Eddie recommended one.
If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away.
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
Ludwig? He's gay - are you jealous?
Is he your boyfriend?
I'm sorry.
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
Are you alright?
They're not gonna send you right back.
I know.
I'm not a whore. I'm not a whore.
I'm just trying to find out who you are.
What are you asking me?
So you were never a prostitute?
What about back home?
Did you ever turn tricks before?
Yes, I considered it.
You considered becoming a prostitute?
Yeah. This way.
So...the station is empty?
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.
Somewhere else?
I can't take you to my place.
Are you married?
They won't until this is over.
I will if they don't send me back.
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
Now I become custody of police department?
Yes, but he was a cop.
Alright. That's a justifiable homicide.
You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
I'm from a small town in Slovakia. Like the South here. The Police is right, a civilian is wrong. So I fled.
A cop?
No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
Are you here illegally? Don't worry about that. We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.
Arrest you for what? Why would we arrest you?
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out. Better if it comes from you.
Go on.
Tamina was a friend of mine. My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
C'mon, start at the beginning. You know these people?
I told your partner, I can't help. I didn't see anything.
Yeah, sure. Beep me when you're ready for the press conference.
I'm ready to be briefed. Excuse us.
Oh yeah...? Alright.
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference. How about that? The case is all yours.
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
It was my decision, not his.
There's nothing to talk about. Get a good lawyer. You're suspended until your trial.
But Chief? Over this??
End my career?
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
Forgot? You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
What was I supposed to do? The guy tried to mug me. I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image! This is going to be our Rodney King!
Okay. But not water sports.
Chief - mind if I take her?
No! Nothing happened.
A shower!? Did you take one, too?
I let her take a shower.
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
Who do you think, Chief?!
Who did cause and origin?
Alright. Swing by her apartment. Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street. You got that?
Yeah. He finished awhile ago.
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
You do that, wiseguy. Now let's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does.
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief. As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
What was that, Korfin?
Yeah, right.
Don't you guys understand? It's all about image. The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.
I know. Relax. Take it easy. Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
He got my gun! Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
No. I'm okay.
Are you hit?
Stay with her.
The other side of the street. The guy with the videocamera. Don't look - put her in the car. Stay this side.
C'mere. You wanna go to homicide school? Here - make yourself useful.
Only one guys checked in?
It's okay.
Sorry...PD only.
Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
Any I.D.?
Takin' a bath.
Where is she?
A timer.
What's he looking for?
You ready?
Tomorrow. At lunch.
I'm gonna propose.
It was freaky, I'll tell you. Stupid kid.
Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
Vodka tonic.
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison.
He had a videocamera? Where is she? Quickly!
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes. Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build. And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
Describe him.
He said he was her cousin. I told him where she works. They were just here.
Daphne. Another guy came in asking me about her, too.
What are you saying?
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
Did you tell him you did?
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
Oh my G-d. Honey! Honey's dead?
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
What's wrong?
Homicide, Miss Hearn. It's Detective Eddie Flemming. Open up.
I have nothin' to say. If you wanna contact my attorney...
Police. We'd like to ask you a few questions.
Who's there?
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief? Why'd you stand up for me like that?
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not. Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
Yeah, just her in the shower. Nothing happened. Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...
Just a shower?
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs.
Hey. I'm a professional.
You know what I'm saying here.
You're her Savior? Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
C'mon. You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity. She sees me differently.
So am I.
I'm serious here.
My point exactly.
I don't have a girlfriend.
What would your girlfriend think of that?
You wanna talk to her alone?
Look - let me talk to her. Any leads I get, they're all yours. Just let me have a first crack at her.
Raw deal.
She's fucked. Even if that story is true.
Something back home?
Why not?
Is that all there is?
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
What are you hiding? Why are you afraid
Then I guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we? If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first.
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
Of course.
So am I. Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
I'm on duty.
You thirsty?
I'm on my way with Eddie. Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison. The suspects might be there already.
Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon. Ludwig's.
Better than one.
Two heads.
I'll call it... tails.
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me. If you don't win, you don't come.
This is ridiculous. I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
I'll let you know what happens.
But what if it does? You might need my help.
This has nothing to do with your fire.
Mind if I ride along with you?
You got any better ideas?
You goin' to the escort service?
Stay here.
My folks are.
You're Polish?
My parents are from Poland. I can help with the Eastern European angle.
This isn't homicide school.
I can watch you, Eddie. Maybe I'll learn something.
There wasn't a fire. There'll be nothing for you to do.
I'll come with you.
Eastern Europe. Like what? Romania? Hungary?
What would you call her?
Who says she's a suspect?
Maybe you don't care about that either. Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too. What about the report?
Sure. But I would like to ask you something. You got a problem with me?
Did you get a report from the M.E.?
Good. Good. Commendable.
I don't even watch TV.
Nah, why should you?
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
Well, just so you know. I gave you guys the credit.
Nah, I musta missed it.
Watch the news?
It's your crime scene now. You can do what you want.
Why don't you explain it, Bobby. Hey Camello! You mind punching a hole in the floor?
No, what is it?
You know what that is, right?
No, we don't mind. You mind Leon?
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit? How fuckin' stupid are you?
If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments. They going to have real movie this time.
Good - be tough to the end. Actor who plays you will want to die like hero.
Then do it, asshole.
I kill someone famous.
What's your accomplishment.
Your opinion. You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie. And write books.
What do you want?
So...who's Nicky?
Don't be late.
Thank you.
See you later. Good luck.
Yeah, yeah. Good thing.
Yeah. I promise.
You promise?
Okay, til tonight.
I love you.
Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
Yeah. I'll do that. As long as you're not patronizing me.
I'll tell you tonight. Let's do it tonight. As soon as you get back we'll talk. We'll talk.
No. No, listen to me here. I want to know what you're talking about. You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
No. Go ahead. You're gonna be great.
Okay. That is great. But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
Well, that's great.
That's good.
Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor. They want me to anchor tonight!
Okay. Okay. Hold that thought just for a second. They only call me when it's an emergency. Just hold that thought. Can you call back?
Answer it.
No. Tell me what you want to say.
Answer the phone.
Don't worry about the damn phone. I won't answer it.
Jesus. And last week you came over with blood on your shoes. What am I going to do with you?
Could be Leon's.
Look at this. You have blood on your shirt. Whose is it?
You're not so bad yourself.
You're ruthless.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that? Huh?
You were merciless. You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
That was good. You were holding the evidence.
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence. That was...
Yes you are. I'm not just some reporter. I don't just stick a microphone in your face. You could give me something.
I'm not.
Alright, alright, Eddie. Don't patronize me.
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
Stop it.
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I embarrass you, sweetheart? Oh...
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues. You could give me something.
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
What is your problem? Why'd you snap at me? I just wanted a statement.
Hey, honey.
Yeah. Now's not a good time.
Eddie, are you okay?
Alright, cut, cut, cut.
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt. He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Do you have the suspect in custody?
He was hurt, but not seriously. He'll be fine.
Okay. But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you. Is this somehow related to the fire department?
I can't talk right now. We have some things to take care of.
Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
We don't know. When I have more I'll let you know.
Is it drug related?
You know you can't do that. C'mon.
Can we go up to the crime scene?
There are two bodies found at this point.
How many victims are up there?
We don't know that yet. It's much too early. There's a lot to be done.
Detective, does it look like a murder?
Again? I didn't wanna do it the first time.
Any chance we can do that again?
Yeah, yeah. Jesus.
Okay. You ready?
Keep them out of my way.
You're worried for my safety. I'm touched.
I hope this prick doesn't run. My knees are killing me. Stay behind me.
Yeah. And he still went to the party.
That's unique.
Not what. Who.
So what's unique?
How old are your kids?
I'm not moody.
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
Sooner or later that's everybody.
Jesus Christ.
No. Are you proposing?
Are you married?
Dog food.
And what do you do with the bones?
You stuff sausage in it.
You're a butcher? What do you use pig intestines for?
I am butcher.
Okay. You work in a vodka factory. I understand that. And what kind of work do you do?
Come alone. Bring cash. And we'll talk about surrendering.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show. And they will show it.
What? It doesn't work that way.
We'll talk about that. Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank. Three hundred thousand dollars.
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
No. I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
Look asshole. I've been threatened by better than you.
Come to 45 Broadway. Don't bring the Police. Come alone or you'll be in my next film.
If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her.
Let her go! Let her go!!
Tell him to put his gun down!
The Sheraton! On Broadway! Room 210. Go get Oleg. He'll kill you.
Where's your partner?
Get down on your knees.
C'mon. Pull the trigger. Do it. Oh, look, you're sweating. You don't have the balls.
You'll be my first.
You can't kill me. You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun. I bet you never shot anybody in your life.
Tommy, take a walk.
My father was. He gave me many lessons about fire. Now it's my friend.
Were you a fireman? That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
Alright, alright - don't hurt me! Please, it's in my book, in my purse!
Give me the address!!
Look, man, I don't give a shit if you want sex or not, but you're payin' for my time.
Listen to me. I don't want sex. Just give me the address and then you go.
I like to talk to the person who runs the service. Can you give me address?
That's confidential. Could you put the money on the dresser?
Where is escort service?
It's an outcall service run out of an apartment. I don't meet the other girls. Aren't you gonna get undressed?
I ordered a Czech girl. Daphne, you know her?
Now I like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure. Why don'tchya put my money on the dresser.
Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be. I'm a little schoolgirl, I'm mommy, I'm a Czech girl.
Where's Czech girl?
Hi, I'm Honey.
He doesn't speak English.
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
Two weeks.
How long are you planning to stay?
We are both from Prague.
Is there a problem?
Please join us. Come on forward.
Is he with you? Are you travelling together?
Can you show me? Sir, no cameras in the FIS area!
I have five-hundred dollars.
How much money are you carrying with you?
Two weeks holiday.
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
Yes sir.
Next. Could I see your documents, please?
Yes. Both.
Million?! The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
In here, says he wants a million.
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
This all you want?
New York's finest. This is his case.
Who is he?
No. You are the traitor. You are murderer. I am director. Action!
You think you are a director? You are a fucking little, small Russian piece of shit. And I hate you. I fucking hate you.
No, I don't get that!
You got that?
Yes. But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.
I'm serious...this - this is a great American film. Full of violence and sex. And I want my credit.
Your idea? I thought it was my idea.
Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
Be quiet. Watch.
I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
Bad last moment - I cut it out.
This is my project. I say 'action.' I am the director! You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.' And 'action!'
Shut up. Look!
I'm serious.
The one who got caught in the bathroom. George Michael.
In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?
You are success story? I am success story! Why do you say I and not we?
Okay. He has nothing to say. Start the camera!
Good idea!
This way. Hold it this way. Good.
Sit down!
Let me get a shot of it.
What does it look like? It's an address book!
What is that?
Put the camera down, Oleg.
Why not?
And the whore's murder? You didn't erase that either, did you? Don't lie, I won't be angry.
I did.
The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
What is it?
Don't want to film this?
Oh, shit. I hate looking at that!
Does it hurt?
Shut up.
Gotta light the scene better. Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.
Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up!
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
Get in the bathroom!
I'm homesick. You have Eastern European girl? A Czech girl?
I'll do it. Don't hurt my camera!
How you erase this?
You said speak Czech!
Speak English!
I'm not filming. I'm watching Milos die. It's just like a move but realer.
Turn that fucking thing off!
Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
Why should I carry your bag? I am not a dog.
Turn that off! Get the bags.
We have no money. Come on.
Look. New videocameras. Color viewfinder. Image stabilization. Solarization. Night vision.
Why? Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
Don't speak Russian!
Look. Times Square. Just like in the movies!
I want to document my trip to America.
Did you hear what I said?
Don't fool around.
Just do what I do. Say the same thing I say. Don't open your mouth.
You spent all the money while I was in prison? Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!?
We started over, you can too.
A job?? As a plumber??? You think I come to America to work!
It's easy to learn.
As a plumber?!
Yes, the money is good.
A job?
I can get you a job.
Look at the way we live. I'm a plumber. You think I'd be working if I had money?!
Ha. Ha.
We spent it!
Milos. Get my money!
You know me...I never hurt anybody. Where's the money?
Did you hurt her?
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
Surprise! Surprise!
You want the tape? There it is!
Viewer discretion advised!
Trust me, you'll want to take this call.
I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy! I can't talk business. Hang up. Have a drink. Get her a whiskey.
You've got a call.
What are you doing here?
Don't give me that fucking shit.
If I didn't put it on somebody else would! I was his friend!
You outta be ashamed. Ashamed of yourself.
This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
And you, you'll pay for what you did!
Paulie, you've got kids, right?
In love? With who?
Of course he's moody. He thinks he's in love.
Isn't he a little moody?
That morning. He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
Alright. Go ahead.
I'm trying to tell you.
I want to hear everything he said.
Well, he...
What do you mean you know? He told you he was gonna propose to me?
I know.
Excuse me?
Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
I'm here for movies.
What are you coming here to do?
A cheap hotel.
Yes, we're in New York now. But where are you planning to stay in New York?
New York.
Then answer my questions. Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
I speak English.
Okay. You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national. How do you know one another?
Yes...he's my friend.
He's yours but I take him in! I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.
Well, he killed my partner!
He's my collar!
We're takin' him. Don't argue!
No way! He's mine!
I'll take him.
Evidence. Of a homicide.
What was that?
Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other? You got to hand it to them.
That's what it looks like to me.
So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?
Thanks. Appreciate it.
No. Go ahead.
Your civil rights?! You tried to rob me! I could arrest you right now! You're lucky you're walking away from this. Now get outta here.
A dog pissed on me!! I'm gonna sue you for this! You violated my civil rights!
You okay?
Hey. C'mon, you can't leave me like this. Some freak'll come by and stab me!
I'll send a cop back for you.
Oh yeah? Guess again.
Fire Department? Firemen don't carry guns.
Okay, you're under arrest! Now you happy?
Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin' money?
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
Got any spare change? How 'bout a spare twenty?
Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.
Yeah? What kind?
I used an accelerant.
How did you start the fire this time?
Yeah, I'm religious. I'm not an Atheist like you! Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
They were inside. They booby trapped her apartment!
What the hell happened?
Get outta here!
Not good.
How was it?
Lay down. Stay down, Bobby.
It hurts. Aw, Jesus!
Bobby, Bobby! Where're you hit?!
If I go home I won't be able to fall asleep anyway.
Aren't you tired?
You go home. I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.
You hear that question, Garcia?
How long they been livin' here?
Maybe you can be his stand-in.
Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.
There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us. She looked scared. Oh shit! Oh no!
That's why he was so quiet. He was testing us.
He knew all along.
You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer? Wish I had a picture of it.
But you knew that, right?
The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out. Let it run.
Don't blow your nose!
Mouth's clean, too.
Could you put out the cigar? Part of the job is picking up scents.
Nah, not at all. Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin. My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.
'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now!
Oh yeah, why?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
You see anything in the crowd? Anybody suspicious?
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
I heard. Who the hell let them up there?
Where you been, man? We got a celebrity!
GET OUTTA HERE NOW!! GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!! DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL KILL YOU, TOO!!!
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
Take the car. Get outta here, Tommy.
Don't stoop to his level!
Don't you get it? He knew he was gonna get caught! That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
What are you gonna do?
The clerk?
Capra? That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
That doesn't apply to me because I'm not a criminal. I'm not a criminal! I wasn't convicted.
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
We're in negotiations, that's correct.
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
Look, I'm in here. You call this a career move?
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
Yes. My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
Your doctor?
We're trying to get there. I hope we can.
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
How did they manage to do that without any communication?
Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
She's wonderful.
I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.
Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
I guess not.
I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.
Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.
It's the last one.
Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.
Two more.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
You're kidding.
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
Are you reasonably awake?
Good morning. How's it going?
Anyway, it's just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry.
Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
Well, that's something.
Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.
I guess it isn't.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
But not completely inconceivable?
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.
That's true.
Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
Yes, I thought so.
That seems very unlikely.
I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
I suppose the idea was specialized training.
No. I never did, either.
I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
It's possible.
Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.
It's about my salary cheques.
What's up?
Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
Sure, what is it?
Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.
Okay, come on down.
Right. Just a sec.
Hi. Frank... coming in, please.
I am prepared to do that anyway.
Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.
I don't really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
The antenna has to be replaced.
I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?
Yes, it is.
Too bad about Frank, isn't it?
Well, that's a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission.
Yes, it is, Hal.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
And don't you worry about it.
Well, don't worry about it.
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.
Hal, is there anything bothering you? Anything that might account for this problem?
I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.
Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
You probably also know that we found them okay.
Yes, I know.
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
Sure, Dave, what's up?
Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something.
I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.
The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.
MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.
What is it, Hal?
Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.
He's got a point.
I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.
Still, you really don't believe it, do you?
Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
Well, what is it?
Did they have any explanation for this?
Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
Goodbye, Daddy.
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Yes, Daddy.
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
Thank you, Daddy.
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.
Three, darling. One... two ... three. Be sure to tell Mommy I called.
How many days until you come home?
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
She's in the bathroom.
Where is Mrs. Brown?
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
In three days, darling, I hope.
When are you coming home?
No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.
Are you coming to my party?
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
I'm having a party tomorrow.
I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
I'll bet it's a fortune.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
Well, how's it going back there?
Thank you.
Oh, thank you very much.
Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
Well, I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. conference in June.
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
Well, that does sound very odd.
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
Well, where are all of you off to?
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
How is gregor?
Oh, that's such a delightful age.
Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
And your charming little daughter?
Yes, it's coming along very well.
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Yes, I think so. Just about then.
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Yes, very pleasant.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
How do you do, Mr. Miller?
Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
Well, I'm glad about that.
Fortunately, they did.
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
I see.
That's right.
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.
Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
Yes, really, thank you very much.
Are you quite sure?
I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
Any ideas about the colour?
Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
Any clue as to what it is?
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?
Well, thank you very much, and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable.
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
I see.
What do you mean?
Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
Thank you.
Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
When do we arrive at Clavius?
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.
All right, Hal. We'll take care of it. Let me have the hard copy, please.
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?
Let me see the tracking alignment display.
I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.
It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.
Yes, Hal, what's up?
Opening pod bay doors.
Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors.
Hal, check all airlock doors secure.
Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
I understand.
Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
Five by five, Frank.
Hal, have pod arms secure the component.
Thank you very much, Hal.
That's true.
That's true
Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
That's true.
That's true.
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
I will if I can, Frank.
Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.
Great, just great.
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
How about chargin' the battery?
We don't wash 'em, ya know.
Yeah, I've been busy.
This is three years old.
I want to pick up my car.
Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.
Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place. It's the only thing I know.
I don't give a damn about his girl...
I don't give a shit who you ask.
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
Fuck off. I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
Now how's your memory doin'?
No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you know, a squaw.
Hey, what about me?
He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.
Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.
Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it. I never paid for it in my life.
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
I never paid for it in my life.
Yeah, dummy. Money.
Pay money?
Whaddya mean, buy?
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
I ain't tired yet.
I want to drive awhile.
You got a real big mouth, convict.
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.
Now you're talkin'. See ya...
I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin', okay?
Hey, don't do that. I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
Here you go, baby.
I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business. As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.
Hello, again.
Here's hoping, baby...
Well, maybe I'll see you later ...
No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...
What's the matter with my place?
No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
You're in a hurry.
Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.
Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
Hey, what kind of talk is that?
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust. You interested?
I'm candy...
In the back. Down the other corridor.
Where's ganz?
He can live or die ... You let us in and he's got a chance to make it. Otherwise, he gets ventilated.
No chance.
You're gonna help us take him.
Yeah. Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...
No time for any of that crap any more, lady... I'll rip your lungs out if you don't answer fast.
Would you guys...
I hear you've got visitors.
How about it?
Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
I said police. Now drop the goddamn gun.
I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.
You're done. End of story.
I got hit. I can't believe it. I got shot.
Whaddya mean...I got your gun ... I got his money... I got everything...
I don't think you're gonna make it.
After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
You lying son of a bitch...
No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook? Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
It's your money. It'll be here in six months when you get out.
There's nothin' to talk about.
Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic.
Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick.
You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...
Yeah. But I wasn't there for a second.
You okay?
Well, you got to admit we come a long way.
Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine. You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
Hey, there she is...
I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it.
What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit? I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro.
If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
Do I get to kiss her too?
Yeah, too bad. They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV...
Don't worry about it.
It's late, they're closing...
Yeah, but we didn't get 'em.
Naw, you didn't let me down. It was a long shot all the way. We gave 'em a good run at it.
Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.
I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one. It'll be my good-bye present.
Back to jail in my own car. Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
I had it impounded. Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
Hey, how'd my car get here?
Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
Notice something funny about that bus?
Luther's on the move...
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
That was quick.
I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel. All I need is some money for the room.
Yeah, I see her.
Yeah. Guess not.
Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
You sure that's the reason?
Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
Tell me something. Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
So you took the rest of the night off...
Let him get some sleep. He's going to need it.
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
We missed.
What about Ganz?
What about Luther?
Hello. And goodbye.
Be polite. Say hello. This is Candy.
Where's luther?
I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?
No way...
You stay with me...
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.
That was in style a couple years back, man.
Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?
Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
No class...
What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.
Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...
If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.
Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...
You got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile...
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
That ain't philosophy. That's common sense.
I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...
Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd just leave town.
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
I had no choice. Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac.
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?
Musta got some primo bondsman.
Guess what? Luther just got in line.
You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.
I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
You just drove by it.
...For three years? Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
Where's the goddamn car?
Yeah. Right.
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Right, partner.
In the trunk of a car. A lot better than under a mattress, right?
Where's the money?
Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
You gonna let me keep any of it?
Not likely, convict.
We split 50-50?
You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?
He's after your money.
Just tell me about the money.
Half a million.
How much?
I been waiting a long time for some money.
One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
They saved your ass, convict.
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
Yeah, right. You want to try again?
Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
You wanna leave, man? Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
Let's go.
Come on.
Must be billy's girl.
While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.
You made that move, huh?
Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
The bet's off.
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
What are you talkin' about?
I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
That's never been one of my problems.
Why? Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
I got two problems. Number one, I'm not playin' games. Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
Hey, you wanna bet?
You need five years training to handle a joint like...
Bullshit. Attitude and experience get you through...
But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
Back you up? Now why would I wanna do that?
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
Sure. Then we had a fight this morning.
You have a good time?
Last night.
Last night, two nights ago, three?
I don't give out the details.
Mission District. Gonna find us an Indian.
Now, where we goin', convict?
You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
We eat when I say we eat.
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim. And you fucked' it up.
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
I think you better put him on ice, man.
What do you think?
Want to try it again?
Thank you.
Hey, this works pretty good.
Just throw me the Goddamn gun.
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.
I'm helpin' you, huh?
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
I may call you worse than that.
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
I don't give a damn. It happens to be my name.
Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
Luther was part of the gang?
Okay, let's get down to it. I did my part and got you out. So now you tell me where we're goin'?
It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
Shit. I'm already sorry.
No way to start a partnership.
You just don't get it, do your Reggie? There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
Hey, no way. Take off the bracelets or no deal.
You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...
We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers...
What are you talkin' about? This suit's mine. It cost $900.
This prison gives out $400 suits?
I'll think about it.
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
I got a lot to protect.
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out. I got to be on the street. Get me outta here.
You're crazy.
I can deliver Ganz. But you gotta get me outta here first.
Didn't work out that way. He busted out with a big Indian. They capped two guards on a road gang. Nice meeting you Reggie.
Ganz is in jail. He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
Yeah, I noticed...
Not likely, Reggie. Maybe I just need some help.
You here to write my life story?
Sure, anything you want.
Try Cates. And let's talk in private, okay?
You got a name, cop?
I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
Where the Christ do you think you're going?
Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.
He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.
I didn't have the time.
Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
What a screw-up.
You couldn't get to him?
The Indian. I was about 30 yards away.
Which one pulled the trigger?
They ran. As fast as they could. Caught a train.
How did they get away?
I lost them, that's what happened.
What the bell happened?
I'll keep it in mind.
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
Yeah. It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
Hey, the bastard's got my gun. I want it back.
Yeah, I read the report...
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
I guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible...
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure? Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.
The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?
But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
That's what you say, Cates...
I'm not paid to take your personal calls. He was in some bar. .. off duty.
Jesus Christ. Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
I almost forgot. That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.
Okay. See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
I got to wait for a call.
I'm heading out. How about you?
Bullshit red tape.
Nothing came in for me yet? No calls?
Doesn't look like it.
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
So do you...been a long day.
You look awful.
One of em's in the slam.
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking. Can we find them?
Hey ... Dick Tracy.
Tell me that's not the same guy.
Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong. He was in on the same job.
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
Who are all these?
Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.
Billy Bear...
This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.
I'll help you out.
Every last bit of it. The big guy's room was empty.
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
I dunno ... he's gonna call me...
When? How?
He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
I don't know.
I think I met her. Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.
Who gives a fuck what you think?
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
A cop...
That's what I always say.
You're impossible...
He's takin' care of the same business I'll be takin' care of - soon as I dry off.
Tell me.
Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
Where is he?
Three more hours...
Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
Usual bullshit. You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
How'd they take it back at headquarters?
Let's go, Reggie.
What do I know? I'm just a bartender.
Whaddya think?
Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out.
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
So what?
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type. But this Indian...
How do you know?
Nothing. No sign of Ganz. No sign of the Indian. Airport's clean. Train station. Bus station. Docks... Shit...
I've been better...Dead end. No Ganz, no Indian.
You real down?
We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
I can see that. Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit. What happened?
Don't. We've had a hard night.
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
Hiya, kid.
Hey, I don't believe it.
Fuck you.
Hi, it's me...
Just a second, that's all!
Jack, wait...
Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...
Jack? What was that?
The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
So am I.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
No wonder you're so popular.
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
I'm at work, asshole. Where else?
This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
I get that. The job first. Everything else, especially me, second. I get it. I don't like it.
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop. It's not a practical way to function...
Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
Jack, are you okay?
Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...
You made the front page.
Yeah, one of my favorites.
Great place for lunch.
Guess people ought to know who I am...
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Thanks for the coffee.
Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
You sure you want me to?
Call me later.
That's the way I see it, too.
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.
Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
Maybe you ought to buy me one.
What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?
You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
Hey, you know what I really think?
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
I guess he got the message...
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
What'd you do?
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
What's wrong with that?
I'm all wet.
That's the way I see it, too.
You're hopeless.
Hey, you're right.
I still don't think it's loaded.
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
I don't think your gun's loaded...
I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
What am I wanted for?
He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...
That's no bull.
Hey, two days with him is enough.
How would you know?
Hard man to live with.
Shrink major, not a shrink.
I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.
Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.
Who the hell are you?
Alright, I'm coming...hold on.
Keep stallin'.
What do you want?
Shut up.
What do you want? What's goin' on?
What the hell's wrong? I didn't do anything.
Shut up.
Sure, right.
We'll follow you. Take it slow,okay?
Yeah, old times.
We got a lot to talk about.
Can't complain.
How ya doin'?
Hot? Hey, they're not even room temperature.
How hot are they?
What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
Rosalie, you okay?
First, the money.
Let her go.
You try to mess with us or go to the cops, I promise you, I'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe.
Come on, you can trust me. Please.
You chickenshit punk...
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
No! Don't kill her. I can get you the money.
Billy, go ahead, break it...
Don't give me this, we were partners.
Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me...
You want that Indian to snap her neck?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
I want the money, asshole, what do you think? The money that Reggie hid...
Whaddya want? I thought you were locked up-
Surprise, Luther.
I'll got your money to you. No sweat.
Fuck you. You got no right for this kind of play.
Try and take it.
Give it back.
Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?
This ain't a credit business.
Five. On credit.
Five bills.
Don't mess with me. How much?
This is clean shit. No serial numbers and never been used...
How much?
It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
How about some ammo?
I'm sure. Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
You sure?
Naw, right here's okay.
You want to go outside?
Not bad, not bad.
How you doing, man?
I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
Akta dedero ansila do mektet.
No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.
Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!
You know exactly where they are!
Ikset-kiba. Me imanetaba oum dalat!
The case was stolen?
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
The case..with the stones... Where is it?
Napoleon... small.
What're you laughing about?
At your service.
Appipulai Leeloo Minai..
I know...
You are a monster, Zorg!
Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years.
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life! So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!
They are robots!
Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. Look at this empty glass.
No thank you.
...would you like a drink?
Ah, Father... You are so wrong. Let me explain...
...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
Why? What's wrong with me?
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again
I'm fucked!
...We're saved!
That's what I'm saying.
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?
Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?
When is she not in trouble?
Leeloo's in trouble?
Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.
Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
What are you doing?
Of course.
Good luck..
We have to save the world.
What kind of mission?
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
That's what I thought.
It means, "Never without my permission".
Excuse me! Just one thing! She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
I know. I was there when she arrived.
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
Dallas. Korben Dallas.
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
She's an exception..
They all like this in your family, father?
Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
So you do know her.
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it! This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
You noticed...
He's a she!
The girl?
I brought the girl remember?
Who are you?
She dropped in on me... holding this.
That's me. But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here.
Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
What are we going to do?
Thank you, Mr. President.
White turns to black. Light to Dark. Life to Death. For all eternity.
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
Yes..thank God..
Is there anything that can stop it?
And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it.
And then?
We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!
One more reason to shoot first eh?
Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!
It's all my fault. I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
Where's Leeloo?
Good work, my son. Now all we need is a way to get there.
I got it! Everything here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
They really made her...
I didn't know your size.
Yes. Of course..
Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..
Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
What's she doing?
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
Father. You sure she's the Supreme Being?
The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!
Father, will you please explain what's going on?
I can't wear these clothes! This calls for dignity! I have to dress the part!
What is?
It's a miracle!!!
They are... with me...
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
I would like to have died in peace...
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
I don't have time... I need to know.
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
Do you love her?
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
...So Cornelius was telling the truth!
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
Leeloo... is... she's...
The Fifth Element... The Supreme Being... Your wife...
You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...
Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
5'7", green eyes... long legs... great skin... perfect..
So, just how big was this fare?
Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
In your dreams! See you tonight!
Uh... at least fifty.
How many points you got left on your license?
Finger! I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.
I don't need one.
Like shit.
How do I look?
I just found a picture of you.
Don't exist bud.
I don't want a million - I just want one. A perfect one.
You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
At least, the cat comes back.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer your cat to the real thing.
I was talking to the cat.
I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.
Hey bud! Finger here.
Hey, that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
...What's your name?
I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured...
Eto Akta Gamat!
Vito Cornelius?
Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...
You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
Daya deo dono Dato. Dalutan!
...'Scuse me?
Akina delutan, nou-shan.
We will be ready, Lord.
When EVIL returns so shall we.
Time is of no importance, only life is important.
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
Take them and put them in a safe place.
The Fifth Element...
Don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again, you've killed your poor mother with your own hands!
You little sleaze bag!
...Not yet.
Have you pulled yourself together?
They've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour, blockhead!
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!
I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?
...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!
Other than that... You all right?
Yes ma..
Are you listening to me, you ingrate!
I've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.
Hi Ma...
You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
Found it?
6... 5...
Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
30 seconds...
This is a police control action..
I'm sorry..
Thanks for reminding me..
You have nine points left on your license..
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...
How you doing this morning? Sleep OK? I didn't.
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
Yeah... then I sighed... like this.
Is that all?
Look, you did something that set it off. Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me exactly what you did!!
Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
What did you say? What did you do?
Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.
Solid little jobs, aren't they?
Fuck it! Hold tight!
I don't even know what I'm looking for!
It's like a cab isn't it?
You know how to fly this thing?
I'll be right back.
Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?
Not without Leeloo.
Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?
We got to find the leader. Mangalores don't fight without a leader.
He's on vacation.
Six to the left. One to the right.
Got it...
You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?
I didn't have a dad... never saw him... never even heard him. 50 billion people listen to me every day... and he doesn't hear me...
Yeah, very big, a giant.
...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?
I don't think this is a good time...
Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...
I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal?
Uh... not really.
Does it get any better or what!
Oh, yes you will...
Three of us will never fit in there!
...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.
I thought you were divorced.
It's my wife.
What is it?
One reason... I want to stay the only one left alive.
Why not?
I'm not going.
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
You have won the annual Gemini contest and a trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two. Congratulations. Here are your tickets.
I've had enough good news for today
Don't you open your messages?
You're the only one left alive...
And the third one?
Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.
Just one... why me?
Where have I heard this song before?
To save the world.
What mission?
I love you...
Tell me...
Why?... Why would you need me?
Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
But I don't know love... I'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own.
...Like love...
You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!
I want to sleep... forever...
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
I'm so tired...
It's up to you now, Angel!
...The rain falls...
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
The wind blows... the fire burns...
Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?
Protect life... Until death.
I told you not to read all that crap!
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
I'm so very sad.
The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.
You're nothing but a... a...
It's difficult.
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.
No, not at all! I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
Where you going?
OK, you can turn around!
You noticed..
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
You get that off the screen?
You know women normally change five times more than men.
Here we go again...
Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
All 900.
Which one?
Learning language.
Finished what?
What is... Make Love?
Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..
Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!
Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
Dinoine chagantakat!
Oh god!
You hear that?
Uh..you're welcome.
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
I suppose that means "Hi" ?
Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..
At least I won lunch.
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
Not going to open?
You're welcome..
You gotta push the little yellow button...
It's not?
You know you could hurt someone with this puppy..good thing it's not loaded..
Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?
Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow!
Been here long?
The cash man!
It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.
Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.
An elephant couldn't crack it.
This thing solid?
We put it through the cellular hygiene detector. The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..
Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
Talk English Doc.
Have you identified it?
Actually only one cell survived..
This is all that survived?
How much time is left?
They just landed in the desert.
Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.
I want your best man on this!
...What do you mean?
The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
And the Stones? Did you find them in the wreckage?
I managed to contact the Mondoshawan. They deplore the incident, but accept our apologies.
I'm about to, Mr. President.
Staedert? What's going on? Did you destroy it?
My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
Wait or act.
Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
What you are saying is you don't know what this..thing..is.
There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
Perfect, Mr. President.
Is that better?
I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .
Staedert, do you read me?
To fame.. salud..
Then let us toast to your fame! Here Billy..
A weapon against evil. Amazing! I am going to be famous.
Only too well... here you must be parched..
Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..
I'm not at the hotel!
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
Yes, Sir!
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
How's that? Can you hear me better now?
...I can't wait to be among you.
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
Fine, just fine! I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now. But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.
How's our deal coming along?
Got it.
Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?
Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
...Not far, now.
No... not at all. Where are you?
Am I disturbing you?
I just talked to her.
She died in her sleep three days ago. It was in the paper...
Tom... she's dead.
She's all I've got. She's the only witness.
Mrs. Christian.
Who are you calling?
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
You're killing me...
I don't know what to say
Look where we are. Look at yourself. You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
You should have.
No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
You don't understand...
You couldn't?
I wanted to call. I couldn't.
You owe me an explanation. You can't treat me like this.
You're sorry? What was I supposed to think?
I don't know. I'm sorry...
Why haven't you called? Why don't you answer your phone?
It has to be this way for now. It won't be long.
I can't tell you, Amy. You know I can't. You have to trust me...
What's going on, Tom? What happened?
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay. Are you alright?
What happened to you?
Just do it, Amy, please, go.
... What's going on?
What's wrong? Are you alright?
Amy, just listen. Take Cindy and get out of the house. Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
Tom? Where have you been... ?
Amy, it's me. Listen very carefully..
I'm not gonna need it. I won't even wear it. It's a precaution. Don't worry about me.
Why the gun?
It's a missing persons case... a long shot. I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back. We'll take a vacation.
I know.
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing. It's better that way.
I understand.
This is the mortgage. This is Cindy's college money.
Betty's out of town so we're playing next week.
I'm not using him again for anything. He was worthless. You have bridge here Saturday?
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
Sure. I'll call the guy.
You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
I love you.
I love you.
Honey, I'm not, please...
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
Business was fine. I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
How's the detective business?
We've been all through that. I've been on my best behavior.
Okay, I believe you.
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
I'm not accusing you...
Your clothing reeks of it.
Smoking? I'm not smoking.
What's this... have you been smoking... ?
Do you know how much I missed you?
Welcome home.
There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
You know where I can get it? I have a lot of money to spend.
What you see is what I got, mister.
There's nothing harder.
Anything harder?
Mixed hard bondage. Rape films. Sick shit. Buy five, get one free.
What are these?
I promised him to Machine.
What the fuck... !
Nobody knows anything.
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible. Why are you bothering me with this... ?
I'm telling you...
What are you talking about?
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
What do you want?
How cooperative. Longdale will keep you company.
I'll get it. It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...
Bring the film, or we kill him.
He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
Friend of yours?
I remember him.
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?
Shut up, cunt! Do exactly as I say, or I'll put this arrow through your throat.
Look, I don't know what this...
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
Take out your gun!
What are you... ?
Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?
Hmm? Oh, the knifes? They're just props. Nice, aren't they?
What are these for?
They should be here any minute.
Where are the women?
Right here.
You brought the money?
Brooklyn. Don't be late.
Where's that?
He's in. It will be his pleasure.
Machine's in?
I'll do this for you. Fifteen thousand dollars.
Those are two different kinds of trust. Thank you for your time. I hope we can do business.
You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
I'm camera shy.
What's the problem?
I'd rather you didn't.
You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it. I'd like to take your picture. You don't mind?
Well, well, I'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this. You'll leave the money as a deposit? Very good.
We can do that.
He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.
If it's not him, there's no deal.
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
I'll consider it.
I want to watch you work.
And they are?
Is it?
That's five thousand dollars.
Yes. What we're looking for is rather specific.
You said something about money.
A fellow investor.
Flattering. And, who's your colorful little chum?
I'd like to commission a work. I'm a great admirer of yours.
What can I do for you today?
It's an honor to meet you. Thank you for seeing us.
You betrayed us.
You got the guts, tough guy? Gonna kill us all, is that it?
First things first. You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles...
... sorry...
Fuck off.
Leave him alone.
You're a dead man.
Move it, dirtbag... !
Put the gun down, take the handcuffs. Handcuff yourself to the bed.
Is that him?
It's good what you're doing.
You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days. I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
Any good?
Well, that's all I can do. Sorry.
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
I'm not so sure about this.
Why don't they come to me?
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
We do.
I figured you share information.
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
Absolutely. Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...
There are reasons for the way we do things here.
What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive. And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
Alright, Tom.
Call me Tom.
What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?
What do you want? You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ?
That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it." Almost makes you worse.
I never killed anyone.
Easy enough for you.
Do it! Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore. You think it's so easy?
Don't think I won't.
Do it.
Where? Show me where.
I don't know... ... out there somewhere.
Show me where you buried her.
You got absolute zero.
Stop talking.
You can't go to the cops. All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...
Keep moving.
Show me.
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
What did you do with her body?
Nobody saw you bring her in?
What do you want to know? You saw it, you saw the loop...
Tell me what happened.
You enjoy it?
I don't know. I felt like it. I never saw anyone get done before.
Because we're going there.
Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.
I want to know. I want to know exactly what you did to her!
What the fuck do you want from me?
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
Something like that.
It was a lot of fucking money.
That's all? Thirty each. That's all it took for you to murder her?
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
How much did he pay you?
Told him you could get him a snuff film.
Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
I told you, I don't know.
I want his name.
I don't know...
Who is Machine?
What do you want?
Starting to recognize a pattern?
Fuck you!
Don't ask questions.
How'd you find me here?
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
I'm gonna kill you.
One million dollars, Dino. How much did he tell you he had...
What's he talking about?
You killed that girl and you put it on film. You and your pals, you're fucked. You fucked up real good.
What the fuck are you.. ?
You murdered that girl, Eddie. Six years ago...
Who is this.
I know what you did.
I know what you did.
Yeah, who's this?
Celebrity Films.
Fuck you!
Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head. Till then, fuck you.
Look, you cocksucker...
The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie. Where do you get this stuff?
Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
You know how my tapes sell. People eat this stuff up.
Look at him. You think he played it square? How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?
He's lying.
Go ahead, shoot me. Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
Give me the film.
You'll get it when we get there.
Give me the film.
Fuck you.
You almost went over your limit.
Because he could. He did it because he could. What other reason were you looking for?
Enlighten me.
Isn't it incredibly obvious?
Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?
A man like Mr. Christian, a great man... all his money, all his power... a man who attained everything there was to attain...
I'm asking.
You're asking me why?
You're making me very angry.
Shut your mouth and drive!
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
Shut up.
Mary Anne Mathews, that was her name. Her mom remembers her.
Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
They're no friends of mine.
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
Never mind how I found you.
I was well compensated.
Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything. Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.
That's trust. Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.
That's right.
You are a private investigator?
Of what sort?
I'm listening.
Yes, I do have something to say. I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.
Look... that's awful generous and everything...
It's money. People use it to purchase goods and services.
What's this?
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
I'm trying to figure that out myself. I have to see Machine without his mask.
What's next?
"Devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.
I know if I had to pick, it'd be "Choke," or "Devil."
What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you?
You don't need to be here.
Who is he, his name?
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
Who is he?
Who is this, in the mask? Who is he?
Wha... ?
It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me?
Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag?
It's their Presidential Suite.
You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
See ya.
Consider it. Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts. I'll call back.
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
Take a vacation. I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
I'm a working stiff, pops.
Well, I'm in New York now. What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.
Alright, I get the picture.
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline. Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
Where does he sell it?
You're learning.
Specialty product.
His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore. Definitely not for the squeamish.
A weirdo making S+M films? Who'd have thought it?
Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.
Good question.
So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
A daughter.
I see a ring on your finger. You have any kids?
What about me?
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed. What are you talking about?
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
I don't know, where are yours?
Where are your parents?
How old are you?
What other ways are there to get illegal films? Who do you see?
I heard you asking. That guy wasn't yanking you around. There's no such thing.
Snuff films.
Child pornography.
Interesting theory.
Wake up, pops. Your education begins tonight.
... Hello... ?
See you then. Oh, and, don't call me "pops."
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
Here's my number if you need it... When can you start?
Sounds good, pops.
Four hundred a week, off the books.
How much do you make now?
How much?
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
From Pennsylvania. P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
Not quite.
You're a private eye. Like Shaft.
I'm not a cop.
You're not a cop, are you? If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
There's not much illegal.
Well, here's the deal, Max. This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
Three, four years.
How long you been working there?
Good for you.
I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.
Thomas Welles. Nice picture.
I need some information. Thought you might be able to help.
Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right? Told you you would.
Remember me?
Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
I tear off the cover and paste this one on... You know how it is.
Truman Capote.
Catchy title. What are you really reading? Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.
Once you pick it up you can't put it down.
I'll risk it.
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
Pardon me?
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
Yeah... guess so.
Big date tonight?
If you have a pencil and paper, I'll tell you how to send it.
How will I get it to you?
I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you approve.
I've made progress. I'm in Manhattan. Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
Nothing more than a bother. Have you any news for me?
I hope it's nothing serious.
I've been ordered into bed. The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
How are you? Having any luck?
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.
You told me to look, so I looked.
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged. No return address. You dug this up all by yourself?
Do you think the film could have cost that much?
I'm here.
Hello... ?
To the penny. Exactly one million dollars in cash.
You're joking.
Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.
Okay, I follow you so far...
The checks were for odd amounts...
I'm not positive this means anything.
My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
Nothing remotely like this.
You've found missing persons before.
I deal in divorce cases. Corporate investigations...
It won't work like that.
You don't have any other choice.
I told you I can't, not yet.
You... you need to go to the police.
Of course. But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
I'm sure it is. It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke. More than likely he never even watched it.
I'm telling you it's not that.
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
I'm afraid I don't...
It's a film... of a girl being murdered.
Cash, stock certificates, and this...
Do you want to tell me what you found?
You hired someone to open it. I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
Just curious.
I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to. Other than that, there's never any reason.
Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?
He succeeded.
I'll do whatever I can to help.
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma. A terrible, terrible dilemma.
My condolences.
As you know, my husband passed away recently. Two weeks ago now.
You are highly recommended. Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality.
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
He's a lawyer. Please, sit, here...
He's odd.
Thank you.
Have a pleasant evening. Will you have tea, Mister Welles?
Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.
Uh huh, pleasure.
I try to be.
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
They murdered her, Mrs. Mathews, I'm sorry. It happened a month after she ran away. She's been dead all this time...
Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
No... no... no...
He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
Who are you?
Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
Who is this... ?
Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.
What... ?
She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...
What are you talking about... ?
I remember. You just left...
Mrs. Mathews? It's Thomas. Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
Hello... ?
It's been six years.
I think about it everyday. But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her.
You were right. I didn't find anything. I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?
My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
Will you let me look?
How... how can you say that to me...?
No. You don't have any reason to think that...
I don't know. I think so.
Do you think the police did a good job?
There wasn't one. The police looked.
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
You should be.
Are you religious?
We're all like that.
I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time. Maybe we can finish tomorrow. I'll call tomorrow...
Of course.
People remember me from the news. Can you drive me back now?
No one knows what it's like. You can't even imagine how much it hurts.
I had to ask. I apologize.
You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
I didn't mean to...
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter... Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
It got to be too much for him.
Why do you think he did it?
We were divorced by then. Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
September 4th, 1993. About a year after Mary disappeared.
If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask. Your husband... he committed suicide?
I don't know.
What was she running from?
She just seemed... depressed... ?
So, she didn't leave a note? She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?
I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.
That's exactly what I am.
They hired you. You're like, a private detective?
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me. He didn't call?
Neil... Neil Cole.
What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...
Yes, but...
I don't understand, who are... ?
Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...
Yes... ?
I'll do what I can.
Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?
That's her suitcase. I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.
Her belongings?
Those are her belongings.
What is this?
I'm trying to find out. She was a runaway. I'm looking into it for her parents.
Do you know what happened to her?
Yes. I remember her.
You... you do? You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
Yes... I remember Mary
Certainly, Senator. If I can ever be of further assistance.
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
He's an imbecile. I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
No, sir, he is not.
None too discreet, is he?
Certainly, sir.
Yeah, I know the spiel. If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.
Okay. Fine.
No, you may not.
Alright. May I have your phone number, area code first?
Excellent. we accept MasterCard and American Express.
Okay, I'll take it all.
Then we'll stay up together.
We'll figure it out.
I haven't slept much either. Since Kristen...
I can't go back to sleep again.
Yeah, or turn you into toast.
It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison? This looks like Sheila's.
I can't find him.
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
It was bad.
I heard you screaming. Was it a bad one?
You alright?
Kincaid and Joey died last night.
What's wrong?
Alice, you think you can leave?
Never say can't. Just do what I do.
Rick...I can't.
Look, you gotta stand up for yourself. Learn to fight back.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
Yeah. She'd be half as strict as you.
I don't want to.
The mirror. You can't see yourself in it.
Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.
Kristen, what happened?
When I used to have nightmares. I brought my friends in to help me. Until they all started dying.
You what?
When they're all you have, you kinda become an expert.
How'd you learn so much about dreams?
I daydream. you have to dream about some place fun. Remember you're in control.
Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?
No really, it's a fable. The 'guardian of good' dreams. It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
Sounds like a game show host to me.
My mom taught me when I was little. Did you ever hear of the dream master?
You could do worse.
I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.
Yeah, I'm not so sure.
I'm sure they're around.
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid! God, I can't find them. I can't find them anywhere.
Here you are. Where were you this morning? Rick's looking all over for you.
Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together. Look...
Then you saw him, too?
That obvious, huh?
You've been up all night?
We have matching luggage.
Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.
I know.
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much. You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
I know. I hardly have any time to study.
I gotta get to the library before it closes. Killer physics test.
You in a hurry?
Save it for later. Come on!
You look great!
Debbie. She's gone. I've...collected her, like the others.
What the hell was that?
Something's wrong here. It feels like...
Here we are.
You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.
He's going after Debbie. I gotta stop him.
It's okay, we're just about there.
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
Cut that shit out. Maybe before, but not now. I want to help you. I'm on your side.
You just feel sorry for me.
Hey, you're not alone. We have to stop him, I'm with you.
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
Try what other kids did. Keep each other awake. We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
Then what else can we do?
Yeah, right. Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room. Adults won't see it. They can't.
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
You don't really get it. He's not a nightstalker. It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.
I don't think so. I guess this is my own war.
Is there something we can do?
Not really.
Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?
Three days.
How long have you been awake?
The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
Look, you know why, you just don't believe me.
Extra money, huh?
I've been working double shifts.
Kristen's story really got to her.
No, don't! I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!
"In her dream"?
I was there in the dream. He took her. It was awful. It was awful...
It was no suicide. It was not an accident. It was Freddy, and he's coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.
I thought it was an accident. Smoking in bed.
I know. Uh...Alice.
Tell him I was looking for him, okay? I'm Dan.
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen. She wasn't feeling very well.
You're his sister, right?
I saw it. It was my dream. I brought Sheila in...
Enough of that crap.
It was Freddy.
Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack? She was gonna be a doctor.
Give her time. Beauty is skin deep.
I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
Alright, I think I see salvation...
Rick, please.
What else? You ever look over this town's history? Not a safe place to be a teenager. Anyway, if I'm next, watch your back.
About Freddy?
She's blaming herself for Sheila. I know how it feels. I've been thinking about Kristen. Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
How she doing? I ran into her last night.
Been up with Alice.
She knew she was gonna die.
Hey man, we're all sorry...
Now it gets weird. She says he comes back in dreams. If he kills you there, you're dead for real.
Nice neighborhood.
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
She told us the story of Freddy. It's a town legend. He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
So what's up? What'd I miss?
Let me talk to you.
I don't get it.
Excuse me, ladies. I'll just be a moment.
Hey, Rick!
Earth to Alice...
T-T-Thanks Alice...
Mother, you've just murdered me. Take that to your goddamn therapy...
Honey, we went over this in therapy.
I'm sorry honey, but...
Your distraught. It'll help...
What's wrong with me?
You're just tired. Don't think I haven't noticed your not sleeping. That has to stop, honey.
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
Something the matter with the cuisine?
I told you you can't help. This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.
It's okay, babe. We're with you.
It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
I'll tell you later.
It's no story. It happened. Freddy's real and he's back.
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
Oh God! He killed them!
What is it?
When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.
Something wrong with the stairs?
Don't worry, honey
You don't get it, he's after me...
You just stay put. You need rest.
I gotta get out of here.
You had a nasty bump.
Yeah. I guess so... What happened?
Feeling better now?
You're not taking my baby!
We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.
What are you talking about? My "condition"?...
In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --
And ours. It's our grandchild.
Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no. He is my responsibility.
What I what? Well, I've thought about it. I plan to keep him.
Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?
It's okay, Dan
Excuse us, dear.
He says it's easy. Especially with sad people. With closed-off people.
But how...?
It's where he hides out. Inside. That's how he found me.
What do you mean?
He's inside you, where he hides.
Where is he?
Come on downstairs. He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
My friend, with the funny hand.
Who says I don't like you?
Who said I...wait, what?
No you're not. You don't even care about being a mom. How come you don't think about me?
Oh...I'm sure that's not true. I'll bet she's very worried about you. I would be.
She doesn't want me around
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be. Maybe we should go find your Mom.
Is that who you're waiting for?
Been having bad dreams.
Hi, you don't look very well. Are you feeling all right?
I could tell you were sad. I just wanted to see if you were all right.
How did you know that?
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.
My name is...
It's lonely in there, in my room.
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?
Hey...wake up.
Me too.
There you go. Love you.
You're right.
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you. Or me. Or us. Remember...
Yeah...I guess.
You stopped it didn't you? It was probably just a regular bad dream.
No. Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control. For the first time since...all that. I'm scared.
About him?
He'll show up. C'mon, what's really wrong?
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
Okay, babe. What's the matter?
I know.
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris. It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
The tickets.
Sorry, babe.
Jesus! Don't do that!
Hi, beautiful.
But Dad --
No! I won't have you running around in the middle of the night. You're coming home.
I've got to go.
No, I'm not. I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.
You disappointed in me?
Since my little girl became a mom...
Since when are you such a smart shopper?
Very funny.
How was the meeting?
Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back. Make them understand.
I'm so sorry, honey...
It's just across the park.
You sure you don't want a ride to work?
Thanks for everything, Dad.
To take a picture.
Where are we going?
It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.
No. A deal's a deal.
That's in the past. Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
I watched from behind the stands. Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know. "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
I was afraid you weren't coming.
That's okay. He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
He sure loves to stay awake.
So did Dan.
You do good work, Alice.
But how are we gonna --
Jacob. We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
If they actually bothered to bury her.
You think that's the place she's buried?
Yeah...So that's him. And you're not crazy.
Are you alright?
That's the only reason you're alive...
Look...we're all tired. None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
Goddamn it, Yvonne! You don't just run away from this guy! He finds you in your dreams.
And so is your baby. You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
Krueger is reality.
I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you. But, you're like a locked safe. You've gotta start dealing with reality.
I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
I really think you need to calm down now, okay?
Mark knows I'm not crazy. Ask him to show you his hands.
Oh, Alice...no. Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...
I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
You had me scared on the phone. What's wrong with the baby?
Why don't you two stick to reality.
No accident. I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
It was just an accident. Like with Dan.
When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so. End of story.
What's that got to do with it?
They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
Did everyone call everyone?
He must've wandered up from the children's ward. I just wondered what was wrong with him.
There aren't any little boys on your floor.
Have you visited the little boy on my floor? Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?
Alice, it's no dream. I'm sorry...Dan's dead.
It was no accident. It was Krueger. He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore. He's found some other way.
Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey. I've got to go find Dan.
No, the Dan part was nice...
Dan keeping you up again? Put a lock on that window, girl.
Had kind of a long night.
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
She killed herself. Her soul's gonna be in torment.
I don't understand.
No shit.
Poor woman...
Empty plot. Memorial stone. Vacant. They never did put her under. Cool, huh?
But I've seen her grave.
They couldn't prove it. No body! Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.
No, it's our problem, Mark. If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob. You said she committed suicide?
That's their problem.
They think I'm nuts.
Then we'll find another way.
I couldn't do that, Mark. He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.
I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger
Where are you going?
I don't know!
Whoa, slow down. How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?
What, you named it already?
My baby!
Who's Jacob?
Why don't I go make some coffee. There's a lot to tell.
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.
It wasn't her mother. The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.
Nobody thinks that.
Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?
Then get out!
She must've fallen asleep at the table...
I thought about that.
I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today. Could we interest you in someone else?
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta. And...
Yeah. I'm just aces.
Mark, are you okay?
That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
I've got to write some of this down.
Well we gotta do something!
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
Greta, come on. One burger with me?
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.
I think I'm starting to wear her down. Have some anyway.
Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.
I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
Oh man! I could've gone all night without looking at that.
He's right. Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.
You know my mother -- get real. What about Alice's?
That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.
Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
Meet me later. Milkshakes. Cherry pie. Banana splits. And no mom!
My undying love. Have some.
Next life. Oh, what's that?
Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?
All of us. Right?
Bottom line, Alice. Anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he'll have to go through us first.
Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
I want to talk about the baby.
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.
Naah, I'm done. Got to be on shift in a couple hours. Aren't you going in?
Have another one, sounds like you need it.
That means they're gonna give me the key to the pool so I can lock up when I'm done.
All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do. I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...
Makes you look like a nun--
These things are wild... What do you think?
He invited me to his house last night.
You, too?
Stick around, please?
It's okay.
I can't listen to this.
Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!
Two hours a day, six days a week.
Dan. And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne. You've been practicing.
And his 'egghead' son! We'll give 'em a <u>rough</u> <u>reception</u>, won't we?
I don't know.
But if they <u>do</u>?
Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.
Which is the one - we have to worry about?
They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars. But now - I wonder -
I'd sooner swim!
- any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!
Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
Unidentified Flying Objects.
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
That may be. But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
<u>You</u> said it. But I won't argue -
You 'trade school boys' are all alike, aren't you? Anybody who doesn't happen to think like a little gold-braided puppet is, ipso facto, a coward!
What did you mean: I'm 'out?'
Dead? Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
My father! He's not - ?
Your 'out.' This came for you.
What is it?
You could train someone else.
And they thought <u>you</u> could re- place the Skipper?
It was moderate. He'll be all right. But it was out of the question, his coming along.
How is he - ?
It was supposed to be. Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.' I thought it was your father.
What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
Dave - !
Oh it does???
Here - keep these. It wants me to come alone.
I'm with <u>you!</u>
We'll have to look for them later.
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
Somewhere down there?
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?
The sound again?
You hear that?
Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!
You know - it <u>is</u>?
Hey - you know somethin'? It's getting lighter in here!
Strange you didn't hear it. OMIT 274F
I don't hear anything. Maybe you've been down here too long. Why don't you go back up and -
Listen! Hear that?
Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
I think you're right.
How about that! The bow drove half through her, but she sealed herself right up.
Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!
You all wait here. I'm going inside, take a look.
Reef and I can take the Explorer down, clamp it around the eye, and ---
You've got to let us try, Skipper --
Skipper! Look at the depth gauge!
We're stuck tight!
Sounds like it! Distress call, from a small freighter, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. One mayday, then...nothing.
'His' side? I've seen it, all right. A nice, bright yellow!
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
A lot of people think like that.
I guess.
I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?
I might have a son like <u>that!</u>
You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!
Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home. Now -
So they caught up with you, too?
Helen. I appeal to you -
But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work. She deserves a fighting chance!
We hope!
Sidearms? But the saucer's dead.
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable. Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
The frogmen?
You better take Powell and Carney with you --
Right at our one-eyed friend!
What course, Skipper?
A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo!
Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!
Course and speed?
I...don't know!
What about down?
Seems to be all around...
Is there any way out of it?
Right, Skipper.
Get ready. We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard.
We're dead in the water. But it indicates we're moving!
Why do you say that?
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
Something wrong?
Skipper - could you take a look here...?
All internal repairs completed, and Frogmen report exterior damage minor.
Yes, Griff?
Excuse me, Skipper---
What about time...?
Anything ---
Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...
Radiation level...constantly rising...
Now they feel it...down below.
That's wonderful, Carl! Reef thinks they can clear the Shark bow so we can pull ourself loose!
We read you! Go ahead, Doctor! They're inside the saucer. It's filled with breathable air!
As ready as we <u>can</u> be! I'll report to the Skipper.
All ready?
There is. I believe our friend...Cyclops... is returning to life!
There's got to be an explanation!
As we near the Pole...
What direction does the system indicate?
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted....
....in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and, as you put it.... ...'recharging his batteries'?
The North Pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all - the Earth itself!
<u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force. Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear. But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?
What if the Tiger Shark were to anticipate a bit? Perhaps be lying there waiting - ?
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
...above Murmansk, and Finland.
High-intensity arcs will burn, submerged. And millions of volts...discharged in random directions...
Under <u>water</u>?
It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
Minus three.
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
Nothing we can do, now.
Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!
If we could get inside the saucer - use our torches - maybe we could cut the Shark loose?
Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?
And we're at safe maximum depth already.... Stop engines!
It's the screws, Skipper. At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast....
We can <u>ram</u> him!
But - what can we accomplish?
That's what I said!
Right <u>at</u> him?
Thirty-four seconds!
What's the running time?
Take a look.
You're sure it's Cyclops?
After torpedo room: Report!
Determine extent of damage, immediately.
I think I should have joined the Air Force!
What do you think?
It'll be all right. We're old friends!
'Doctor' Neilsen? When did <u>that</u> happen?
Dr. Neilsen. He'll be - -
Who with?
I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef - You'll have to share quarters, this trip.
I met Dr. Kent, once.
Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper.
<u>That</u> might be a <u>little</u> <u>rough</u>!
To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?
Of course. But it is time to be- gin the return voyage --
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
It is a living thing. When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.
On the contrary. I want you - unharmed - perfect.
Why not me? What am I - the closing act?
I am afraid not. Therefore -
He did!
Your friend was to remain where he was!
- for horrors like yourself?
My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
Tell me something: Why can <u>I</u> hear you, when the others couldn't?
Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
That's a <u>face</u>???
Come where?
Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!
All right - go to it.
Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.
Toward the Pole!
Due north. At five knots...no, six!
But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
Or, perhaps, until he gets us?
You plotted the course of Cyclops? Then that's <u>our</u> course! Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him!
Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!
Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer. 'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.
I'll be another!
Well, I'll be - !
See what?
Thank you.
My yeoman will show you to your quarters.
He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
Twombley involved?
What is the Northcountry Development Association?
This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?
As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.
Has anybody offered to buy it?
I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
You don't believe me?
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.
You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to. What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
Always has been.
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
Are you alright, Wade?
No. Black.
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
You got yourself a computer, Alma.
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
Chub says you're fired.
Tell me.
Yeah. I know about that.
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --
Same old shit.
What are you boys up to?
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
This spring.
How soon?
I plan to. Soon.
It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.
I screwed up the divorce. I agreed with everything she said. I wanted her to like me. I just want to be a good father.
That was me.
We bought you.
You can't buy Wade off.
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
Shit! What are we gonna do?
He's on to us!
No, of course not. Just say it, that's all.
Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?
This is gonna be one fucking mess to clean up. Twombley's son-in-law and daughter are up the weekend. Didn't you say you'd seen him, Wade?
You see it?
I hear Twombley got shot.
You heard the news.
You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.
Fresh tracks. Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.
Deers have ears too.
Sun's gettin high.
This way.
Safety on?
What happened?
The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.
They said.
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
Double A. New Britain.
You played for the Sox?
Drafted by the Red Sox.
I used to play ball.
Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.
I'm okay.
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
I get it. No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
You think so.
You might not kill it.
If you get it?
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
Damn straight!
Guaranteed, eh?
It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid.
What do you mean I got money? I'm as broke as you.
I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.
Open the door. We're late.
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
Open the door, will ya?
Out of this fucking job. This job sucks. Working outside in the winter sucks.
I'm fucking out of here.
He sure as hell won't.
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man.
You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
Saw him do it?
Sure you did.
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?
Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?
On your sleeve.
What blood?
Where'd you get the blood?
You stayed away?
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
No, I mean whereabouts.
In the chest.
Where'd Twombley get shot?
Piece of fucking cake.
Bastard's got his high beams on.
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
Like you and Gordon?
Gordon, he's always got some angle working. He wants to keep Twombley happy, I'm his boy.
How'd you get the job?
Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.
Got a job first thing in the morning, first day of season. Saturday I'll hunt for myself. Twombley something. - Er --
Not here.
Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems.
Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
I thought I told you to move that truck!
Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks?
No brag. Just fact.
Where's that gun you were bragging on today?
LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
Don't mind if I do.
Okay, let's go home, then.
I want to go home.
Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened.
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
You're a policeman.
I know.
That's illegal, you know.
You can't.
I want to go home.
I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.
What are you sorry for?
Please don't cry. Please, honey.
Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?
I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
What do you want, then?
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
How about a Big Mac?
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
It belongs to Pop.
It's pretty old.
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
Are we going in this?
I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.
Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.
Where do you expect to wait for her? Obviously downstairs with the other kids isn't good enough.
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
That's all you got to say? "Yes".
She's gone already! Gone already! Couldn't wait.
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
See, I knew you'd be mad.
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
Jesus, why?
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
I called Mommy.
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
No what?
I want to go home. I don't like it here.
It's fun.
It's stupid.
What then?
It's not that.
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
I don't want to.
Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know.
No. She doesn't talk about you anymore.
No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
I just think you used to be bad.
What are you talking about?
I bet you did lots of bad things.
It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.
But it's not funny now.
To us it was.
Was it funny?
Did you do that when you were a kid?
I guess they're stupid.
Yeah. It's stupid.
Break stuff?
You know.
Do what?
Why do they do that?
I don't care. They're out.
Those are the Hoyts.
Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
The key, Wade.
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves. Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
Wade, you're done. Let me have the shop keys.
Could be.
You and Mel Gordon?
I won't. You interested?
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
Want to buy?
That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
You? Why?
Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
What do I have to do for it?
Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
On what you pay me?
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.
You Rolfe? I remember you from high school. You're a teacher now? Harvard?
I'm fine, fine.
How you holding up, Wade?
Well, right now we're not too interested. Finish up what you gotta do, then you can get bugged on your own time.
Yeah. A few things.
Something bugging you?
It ain't done, if that's what you mean.
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.
Like hell.
You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.
I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. That's what usually happens.
Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
You mean Twombley?
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
Fuck. Turn it off. All you heard was there was some kinda accident?
Twombley, Jesus. We got to get moving: I got to get up there. How would I know? C'mon, you drive. We'll take my truck.
I figured you already heard.
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
What's the hurry?
That's what I love about a small town. You know everybody.
Fuck you.
Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.
I'm not saying that.
You don't want the extra police pay?
What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
Don't go playing policeman.
At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.
His son-in-law damn near killed me.
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
Where's the plow?
Told you the snow was coming down. Take the grader.
Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.
Tomorrow, Gordon.
Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.
We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all!
Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.
No problem. Look, I...
Hi honey.
See. Get your boots.
Yeah, lots.
Wait there. She'll be right out. Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?
It's just...
We've done all our talking, Wade.
We should talk.
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
You ever come to your father's grave anymore?
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
I don't want her to go, Lillian.
Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It looks like you've won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for Christ's sake.
She's grown up some, hasn't she?
While you went off for a few beers with your friends? Is that Hettie Rodgers there, with whatzizname?
Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
Where's Jill?
I still don't understand --
Mel Gordon.
Good. Who?
I know who it is.
Did you get his number?
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?
Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
Going somewhere, Margie?
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.
What happened?
This is nuts.
I don't know for Christ's sake!
Of course! I would've heard.
Think they're alright?
The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
I know your parents.
Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
Did you tell them? That we were coming?
Alright. I'll think about it.
You've been married twice --
I've been thinking about it, that's all.
Oh, Wade.
Then... I guess you have to.
Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?
It's nice.
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
What way?
You knew me as a kid.
I can see what you looked like as a kid.
But not now.
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
Jack doesn't need money.
Wade! How can you even think such a thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that, shoot Twombley on purpose?
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.
Tonight. Let's get together.
Call me.
Yeah. I mean that.
You don't mean that.
I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
I'm sorry.
Forget it.
About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
Said what?
I'm sorry about what I said.
You okay?
You okay?
See you tomorrow, maybe.
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party, give me a call, okay? I'm off.
Okay. She's fine.
How's she doing?
For a while.
New hat? Jill's up, I see.
Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze.
Can --?
It makes me sad.
Is...? She's dead then?
When did she die?
Coffee's perked.
Maybe Wade should take a look at it. Your pipes'll freeze. Wade, would you do that?
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
You're not using it today?
There's a furnace.
Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.
Yes. Here's your ticket.
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
Hold on!
Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
What the hell are you talking about?
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'
How's that?
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
Can't it wait, then?
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
Something about my father?
Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
He's asleep. We were up very late.
I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
Who are you?
No, he's out now. Somewhere on the mountain. I'd stay away from him if I were you. He's real pissed.
He got his deer yet?
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
His office. You mean my old office.
It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?
Where... how'd you hear that?
The other guy.
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
You talked to Jack?
Marg! You got orders!
Aw, c'mon, I was only saying there's something wrong with "Home Made Cooking", that's all. The sign's fine. What it says is wrong.
This town sucks.
I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
It don't look right.
You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
Take care, Wade.
I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.
Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!
You and me.
Everything you know is from me.
Call it what you want.
Love! I'm made of love!
Love! What the fuck do you know about love?
Nah-nah-naw! You done done finally done it! Like a man done it. Done it right. I love you, you mean sonofabitch!
You don't know me. You don't know me! So fuck you. Fuck you.
You! By Christ, you -- I know you. Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!
You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
Pop, for Christ's sake!
Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.
Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
In the living room.
Is there something wrong with the phone?
I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
She's coming.
Where's Ma?
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
You remember Margie Fogg?
Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?
You no-good pup!
What was that? You got something to say, say it! Say it!
Just do it.
A lesson in work and its rewards. You'll thank me for this one day. Sally, turn off that TV!
For what?
I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.
But you gotta hear this. You won't believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in his office.
Wade, are you alright?
That's what you think.
Well, I never heard that one.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.
I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
Not particularly.
A hunting accident is perfect.
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
I don't know. You tell me.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
Then who shot him?
That it wasn't an accident.
Which is?
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
Find them everywhere.
Want to know what I think happened?
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.
Well, do you still plan to get married?
What about her?
What about Margie?
Yeah. I forgot.
No thanks. I don't drink.
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?
Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess.
No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
Get some sleep.
Yeah, I guess.
Don't think about it. You're exhausted.
A divorce lawyer. A custody lawyer. You know, 'cause of Jill.
What happened?
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
How was she?
The night before the shooting.
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.
Well, it was an accident.
You think Jack shot him?
No shit.
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.
Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
There was something. It happened up your way.
Jim... for godsake!
Daddy. Daddy, please...
I'm sorry I was so mean to you earlier.
Yes dear?
Big secret. You said the same thing to Newsweek.
You're right and I'll tell you a secret. I know exactly how you feel.
That's not really the point.
Some kids were teasing you?
Your father never means to be so...
When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.
No, it's okay. After all, he is the President, right?
I'm sorry, honey.
He's in a meeting. He can't be disturbed.
I know, Mom. It was great... really.
Back at The Fishbowl?
You're jet-lagged. We'll talk about this back...
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.
Don't you even want to ask?
I'm sure he's busy.
You don't want to say hi to your father?
Yeah, no duh.
Well, you aren't the President, dear.
It's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times.
You are a resilient man, Mr.
He didn't leave us.
It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.
Fuck off, you stupid asshole.
That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
The woman you shot. She was my friend.
Yeah. Do you know what the word &quot;asshole&quot; means.
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
You're one of Stravanavitch's men.
No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
I don't drink coffee.
Okay, I'm slowing us down.
There they are!
It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay.
Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...
Been better, Dad... You?
How you doing, sweetie?
Alice... I...
How `bout a hug for the old man.
It was the experience of a lifetime.
How was... ...the ballet?
Hey, you guys back already?
Oooooh, I'm good.
Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.
The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.
The world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner.
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.
Yes. They refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails.
Did we warn them off?
The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.
cross it... The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
It's cut.
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
Got it.
Do you see the maintenance panel?
Uh, Tower, we got a problem up here.
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control.
Lemme take a look.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
Uh, we got a problem here.
We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.
How we doing, Colonel?
Stay cool.
Got it.
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.
I'm doing what I can.
Who's flying the fucking plane?
He's busy being dead.
Put your pilot on.
You read my mind.
Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.
Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.
That's game, set, and match. There's nothing to do, except call the Chief Justice.
I prefered the terrorists.
They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane, their engines are failing and they're losing fuel.
This doesn't make sense.
They aren't answering their hails.
That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
Walter, if you have a point, make it.
Holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you're making demands.
We don't know that.
He's dead then. They must have killed him.
An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.
Put together a score sheet. I'll make some calls.
Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be. Representative Taylor is working on a compromise.
Thanks. Wrote it last night.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
Sir, you threw out page two.
To swear you in as President.
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
If fired upon, tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage.
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.
Like any good poker player, they're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard.
They still have the President, it's past their deadline and they haven't called. What do you think it means?
Okay. Also, I want you to put our bases in Turkey on alert, and have the Kitty Hawk prepare a retaliatory air strike.
I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
But they start executing hostages in
We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.
Can we do that?
Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?
General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.
My loyalty was never to my country.
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
Because it is my duty.
Yes, Mr. President.
Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?
Ga get it.
That's affirmative.
Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots.
Air Force One, acknowledged. tNT. EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP.
Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.
About goddamn time.
Air Force One, this is AF-135-RA. We have been instructed to refuel your plane.
Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
Where are we now?
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
We're not going to make it.
We've stopped dumping... but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left.
Go! Take Serge.. and watch your backs.
Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
Well it worked.
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
why did they do that?
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
A secret service agent. It must be.
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
Who did this?
Any of us?
How many others killed?
The rest of the secret service?
Sir, this plane carries the President of the United States.
We've already been inspected.
Copy, Air Force One.
Tower, here.
We copy. Stand by... Tower?
Romeo Tango Zulu1 this is Tower.
Stand by.
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.
Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.
Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
You're pointing a gun at me.
Scared. We're scared.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.
And what is it you do, Ms. Mitchell.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
* Please tell me your name.
Thank you.
Here's a press kit. I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews.
Conference rooms, though some have other functions. The one up front doubles as an emergency medical center.
And all these rooms here?
I guess it depends on your perspective.
A dubious distinction, no?
This is a remarkable aircraft.
The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you. Now if you're all cleared? You can follow me then.
Ms. Mitchell. So nice to finally meet you in person.
You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?
Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.
You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
Say something dear.
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
So is this. Come now, you're upsetting the little one.
That was war.
How can you? I mean they're people.
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
Why? Do you enjoy it?
Do you have to be so brutal?
Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night.
My husband is a very courageous man.
I know he left you behind.
What do you know of my husband?
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall? But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
Leave my daughter alone.
Come on, Alice.
Now, or he dies, please.
What do you want with us?
Fear will keep you alive. Any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish, and bound to die.
Hold on, Alice.
No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.
If you put down the gun, I promise not to drop her on the way down.
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
There goes your ride.
One thing I've learned as
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
Someday, you'll regret my nature.
Good. Good.
Yes, I'll do it. Just leave my family alone.
You'll do it?
Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release.
She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me.
No. But since I only have a few of your staff left to kill, perhaps I will start with your family instead... Gibbs.
Over my dead body.
Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so kind.
I'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. Land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel.
Finally, we can bargain.
Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.
Madame Vice president. We have an options paper. chandler takes the options paper, waves off Lee, and reads it as she talks.
You heard me. You. Congress and cabinet heads.
Twenty minutes?
Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied while they're in the air.
That isn't necessary.
Sir, we stay with the President.
Yes, sir.
I'll not going without my family.
Got it.
Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
Get `em ready. You... come with me.
They've cut communication, and I spent a good bit of time looking for alternatives. My only solution ran out of batteries.
We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back.
Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?
Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for me.
The northern border's gotten a bit hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage.
They've gotta be joking.
Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades.
You haven't even driven a car since you took office.
Flying the plane.
What are you doing?
Both of you.
Call Petrov... I'll be back.
Please... don't start with me.
I don't know why you stayed.
Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.
Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign.
How did your speech go?
This promise isn't subject to Congressional approval.
I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
I wish it were that easy...
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
I miss you. And I miss her.
You know what?
How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
She's a big girl. She understands.
Rose, I don't have time for this.
Don't. I know spin control when I feel it.
No, Mr. President. It can't.
Can't it wait?
May I speak to you for a moment?
Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
Someone should give you a raise.
White House Situation room.
Where are we sending it?
No. I thought about this, Mr.
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
The fax machines.
Excuse me?
The fax machines.
Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution?
But this is different, sir. You're the President.
You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
and if that means negotiating...
Then tell me there's a rescue operation underway.
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
Did they say anything about my family?
AGENT +++$+++ Two... THREE. GO!
AGENT +++$+++ One.
AGENT +++$+++ We're handling it, sir.
Where's my family?
AGENT +++$+++ We're under attack.
What's going on?
No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
Thank you for calling the white House...
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?
You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone.
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
Yeah, right.
This is the President.
who can I say is calling?
Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?
White House switchboard. How may I direct your call.
We're hooked. Hove into position.
WE'RE HOOKED!
DO YOU SEE TEEM?
IT'S OPEN!
They better. Fuel's almost gone.
Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.
Twenty-five years.
How long's it been since you flew, sir?
Iraq? Shep, you're fired.
Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.
A MiG? Where the hell are we?
My god. I think that was a MiG.
I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?
Okay. Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?
Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.
Yes, sir.
Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour. I want to review the Iraq situation.
That's my job.
You give me ulcers.
We'll just say it was in bad taste.
I said it's not worth the fight. Steward, please.
Did we tape the Duke game?
Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television. You can't afford to leave that hanging.
It's bait. Don't take it.
Right... Christ I'm tired. Do me a favor and keep me away from the press.
Other way around, sir.
* We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge. The second amendment types'll love that.
I might still have a few chips left.
He and the NRA don't like the wording.
No, no. I'm fine. What did the Speaker say?
You wanna knock of f?
I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.
* CBS said they'll give us four minutes. They thought the Russian was a nice touch.
Commissioner, Aquarius.
Kruger, Sagittarius.
I was asking McCrosky, Commissioner.
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
What's the story?
I was reading too.
Forget it. I was reading.
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
That just doesn't make any sense.
That's right, Commissioner. Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.
I just wish it was that simple.
Bud, get wise to the political realities. The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown.
And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner? Let <u>me</u> talk to them.
Forget it. The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.
Um... Do you people scream right when you... you know.
What is it, Mary?
Yes it did. Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
Felt like a large asteroid.
Yes I did...
Did you feel that?
You better take this.
You better check on it, Mr. Dunn. I'll stay here and fly the ship.
Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.
You better check it, Unger.
We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir.
Accelerators down.
Shut down accelerators.
Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.
Ted, the lever!
We've blown the computer! Elaine! Set course change!
I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
Are you afraid?
The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds. He'll roast like a pig on a spit.
What will happen to him, Ted?
That's right -- premature ejection.
You mean...
Sit down, Elaine. If this bomb trick works we just might make it. Simon was a fool to eject now.
Simon just ejected!
That might be the news we've been waiting for.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
That was very well put, Ted.
I mean until we start to burn up.
Not now, Elaine.
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
Ted, please be careful.
Elaine, I'm going back there. Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.
Ted, there's no time to explain.
Elaine, what's going on?
Ted, a toilet's not going to kill anyone.
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine. I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
I'd use the word insane.
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
The word is sick. Ted -- very, very, very sick.
What word would you use, Elaine?
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
Ted, get a grip on yourself. You should never have left the hospital.
We can't go back. We had something very special, but it's all over.
Elaine, we have to go back.
Ted. I don't know why you got on this flight. I don't know what you're trying to prove.
Not now, Elaine!
I've got it, Elaine! I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
What are you doing, Ted?
Let me by, Elaine.
Ted, we're taking off!
I have to get in there. I have to stop this flight.
Ted! What are you...?
Goodbye, Ted. I don't want to hurt you.
That's the way I want it. Just turn the radio on and go.
If that's the way you want it.
No goodbyes, Elaine. Just go.
His name's David Stockman. He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.
And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.
Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.
Sammy Davis Junior. Terrible car accident. He hasn't been the same since.
Who's that, Ted?
Eat this spaghetti, Ted. It'll make you feel a lot better.
Elaine, what happened to us?
Ted, please. You're just making things difficult for yourself.
You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine! It's all here in the design specifications! Look! It's all here!
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
There's nothing wrong with me!
Ted, you're overworked. You've been flying yourself into the ground.
Ask Simon.
Ted, what's wrong?
I mean the Mercury flight. It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why.
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
It's got to be stopped!
That's not important now, Elaine. We have to talk.
Yes -- last week that pile of mud was only this high.
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.
Is that a good sign, Doctor?
You can be gentle with him, Elaine. He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
I mean for Ted.
You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.
What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?
So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.
Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.
Simon, what are you saying?!
Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends! You'll die out there.
Your career! What about the lives of those people out there. Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved?
My career is shot.
We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.
Can't we change course?
He tried to disconnect ROK. It gassed him. That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.
Simon, what's happening?!
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
That's my girl.
I think so.
Have you got it straightened out now?
Don't be too long.
Meet me onboard, sweetheart. I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
So mentally ill?
Simon, why has he become so... so...
Elaine! Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
No, I've been excited before.
I guess this is a first for you.
I'm so excited, Simon.
Frank's the best pilot in the program.
You're heading up the division in charge of babies for Mr. and Mrs. Simon Kurtz.
But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart. But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.
And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon. I'm a very lucky woman.
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
Roger. You better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
You can do it from up here, Captain.
We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system.
I see. What do you think our alternatives are?
I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.
Yes, sir.
Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan. Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.
Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
Life support check. Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me. You're a woman. I can relate to that.
Request; life support systems check.
Systems check positive. Look, Elaine, I...
Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.
You have great tits.
Go ahead.
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
That's okay, ROK.
Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago.
Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine. I know where I'm coming from on this.
That's not possible.
That doesn't make sense. Repeat analysis.
Intermitant failure in scan mode "R". Analyze.
Look, a man can make an honest mistake!! Anyway, she was asking for it! They're all asking for it all the time!!
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
How many kids get a chance to live on another planet.
It's going to be terrific. A whole new world, new kids to play with.
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.
We'll have to check, Jimmy. It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.
Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?
Do you like it when Scraps sleeps on his back, Jimmy?
He's a boy dog.
Can I hold him?
Come on up, Jimmy. Say, that's some puppy. What's his name?
All right. Here.
Okay, Joey. The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.
I don't want to hear that word!
Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.
We've spent everything on these operations. Is it really worth it? We've pawned your mother's wedding ring. The kids have no winter clothes...
Take this, Joey. It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.
I'm sure.
You're sure?
That's right, Joe. Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids. You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.
I don't want to live anymore.
Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people.
Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?
Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.
Poached! Not over! Over!
All right, Captain Oveur. Over.
That's how I want them. Poached. Over.
Just poached on toast. Over.
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur? Over.
No. Poached. Over.
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary. Over.
Anything. Just don't let Salucci think we're onto him.
What should I say?
No, a bomb. Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge.
A b...
He's carrying a bomb.
Sixteen 'C', why?
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?
Yes, sir, commander. This is Mercury One. Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down.
Whenever your're ready, Captain.
Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger, and your first officer, Mr. Dunn.
Good to be aboard, gentlemen.
Do you think it's necessary to explain <u>everything</u>?
That's how dry cleaning works. Now I'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians.
We don't have much time. Let's move. I'll explain everything.
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
Captain Oveur?
Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
Let's go, Daddy. We have to check in. He was never appreciated at the Institute.
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
You folks need any help?
But that's not a door. The door's over there.
Don't try to stop me!
You can't go in there!
Death, death. How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.
All right, it's a matter of death.
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
No, dammit. It's a matter of life or death.
Do you have an appointment, sir?
I have to see Bud Kruger.
Pull yourself together! We've got to...
Don't talk to me about Elaine. Outta my way!
Then Elaine was right.
That damn computer has taken over. I'm getting out.
Kurtz, you're drunk. Who's in command of this ship?
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
You're tired, Striker, overworked. That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
Look at this wiring. It's shorting out under high temperatures.
You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.
That's right, Striker. And we're getting married when we return.
Are you on the Mercury mission?
Well, we laughed. We laughed all the time.
No. It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.
I just wish it was that simple. We really were in love. You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
Sure. But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
Love's the same as it always was. It's people who change.
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
No. I mean your relationship.
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
Do you want to talk about it.
No, I mean your head. Sit down. I'll take a look at it. I'm a nurse.
I'm getting over it. If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
You've been hurt.
You don't have to excuse yourself. I'm a nurse. I understand.
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
Yes. He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
Uh... oh, thank you. It's nothing.
Excuse me, are you alright? I noticed you talking to yourself. I'm a nurse. Can I be of some help?
That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me.
No. I'm all alone.
I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?
That's a lovely name. Mine's Milton...Milt Ettenhenim. But my friends call me 'Bubbles.'
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.
I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.
Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
Thank you. Cream?
Ah, won't you sit down?
That's very nice of you. Thank you.
I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee.
Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
...but after...awhile...you begin to... ...get used to it.
Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.
Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.
Something about a plane with no pilot?
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.
Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
Excuse me, Doc, I've got a plane to land.
George Zipp said that?
I'm doing everything I can! -- And stop calling me Shirley!
Surely there must be something you can do.
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?
Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?
...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.
Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.
Well, I flew single-engine fighters in the Air Force, but this plane has four engines. It's an entirely different kind of flying...<u>all</u> <u>together</u>!!!
I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?
Surely you can't be serious.
Can you fly this airplane and land it?
Both pilots!
I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?
You can't take a guess for another two hours?
Well...not for another two hours.
Can't you take a guess?
I can't tell.
Captain, how soon can we land?
No. No one that I know of.
Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?
Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.
Just how serious is it, doctor?
He had fish, too.
Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?
Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And Randy says there are five more cases, and they ate fish, too.
He had fish.
What did he have?
Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna.
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
What was it we had for dinner tonight?
It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
A hospital? What is it?
You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.
Yes. Yes, of course.
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
That's right.
Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?
See them, Elaine?
The gear is down.
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
I don't care. I just don't have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before.
But Ted, you're the only...
Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit the fan.
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
Rats! I've lost number three.
It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
And a little ice!
And a little ice.
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!
A lot of people made plans before the war. Like George Zipp.
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!
That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.
What's his problem?
Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.
Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?
Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.
Headquarters!? What is it?
But it won't be. Not as long as you insist on living in the past!
That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
I remember everything. All I have are memories.
I love you.
I love you, Elaine.
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.
What's the matter?
You...you shouldn't have come. I don't have time now.
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
Ted, what are you doing here?
It's too late, Ted. When I get back to Chicago, I'm going to start my life all over again. I'm sorry.
But if you'll just give me...
You expect me to believe that?
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over.
It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
I just don't want to go over it any more.
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
Find out if there's a doctor on board, as quietly as you can.
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
Who wants to be first?
Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.
Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.
We'd better get back now.
We have a visitor.
Good-bye, darling.
Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
Good-bye, darling.
Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
Good-bye, darling.
Every day.
You promise you'll write.
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.
All right, he's on final now! Put out all runway lights except niner.
He's right on the heading.
He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole!
Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.
Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
Did you decide on a runway yet?
Yes, Captain?
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
How ya doing, honey?
What is it?
Oh, I can't stand it.
Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'
Yeah, I think he is. Hey, Fred!
Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.
The hell I don't! I'm out there busting my buns every night.
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?
You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!
I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.
Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!
Okay, this is one of my favorites.
Oh, I'd love to.
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
I'm Randy.
Oh, it's nothing to be alarmed about. We'll get back to you very quickly.
Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?
Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?
I will, but Jim won't.
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?
All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.
No, why don't you take care ot it?
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?
Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?
We have clearance, Clarence.
Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.
Of course.
Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.
Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
Excuse me, Sister?
Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.
Would you go up, please?
Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.
The cockpit? What is it?
Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...
No. No thank you.
Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?
Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
Do you feel all right, sir?
Thank you.
Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.
You okay?
Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
I like my horizons narrow.
There's lots of things I haven't done, but his ain't high on the list. Don't take it personally.
A virgin. I find that very arousing...
Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
Todd? Todd doesn't know either.
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson. Maybe he knows.
Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be. He comes and he goes.
You've got me all wrong. I don't charge money for something that I myself find pleasurable...
Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
Show me.
In there.
She did, did she? Well, she was wrong. Excuse me, I have to change.
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
He's not here. Why ask me?
Ss'ai k'ss? Perfect.
We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--
That's right.
You are Cassandra?
I may be an asshole, but at least I'm a real detective, not some outer shit space thing.
Lay off, asshole.
Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson. Forget you hip waders, big guy?
I'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see how much surfin' you'd do.
Look at your dildo partner. He's too scared to even come down to the sand. You're not gonna get wet standing here, moron!
You ever try to make a case in Slagtown? The list of Newcomer informants is about as long as the list of Mexican war heroes...
You don't have squat.
Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours. Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
So what've you got on Tuggle's killers?
No, Sergeant -- not history... Eternity...
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic.
Sergeant... Detective. I wasn't aware there were any Newcomers at the rank of Detective yet.
I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.
William Harcourt?
Do it!
Kill them both.
This is getting out of hand. I want you to deal with it. Immediately.
When we picked him up, he was talking to those two cops -- the two who came to question you about Hubley.
It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
He didn't recognize me.
This is becoming a serious breach of security.
That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.
You look very good.
How do I look?
You understand that. But how many others will?
But there's no more drug.
Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
We can't let him get away.
I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up.
Tell me about it...
Harcourt is dead.
... It's Harcourt.
What is this?!
Do what?! George-- ?!
No! We must do this alone.
There! Go back. Down that side street.
What's this about, George? I know that look.
With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you will be requesting reassignment now.
Fuck procedure.
Why? What's the big goddamn deal?
The fifty kilos, Matthew. I have to find it. I can't let it get out on the street.
Stay out of this, Matthew. Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will crush your lungs against this wall.
George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones...
Where is the drug? Where have they taken it?
Uh, George...
No, George -- you're missing the point. The drug is evidence. We need to have the evidence, ya know?
If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart.
Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together.
I must trust you, Matthew. I cannot stop this without you.
George... look me in the eye... George, you don't ever lie to me again.
Your people don't know about this part of out past. And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.
Jesus, this is major. Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
Where did he get it? Was there any of it on the ship?
We all did.
We? You've taken it?
Like your cocaine, I suppose. The "high" lasts several hours. We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
How potent?
... It is called ss'jabroka'. To us it is a potent narcotic.
No. I cannot involve you. This is not your concern.
No secrets, goddammit! You don't hold back from me. Whatever is going on, you're gonna tell me now!
You must leave me alone on this.
... and Porter ran a piece of shit mom-and-pop mini-mart. So what the hell's the connection?
Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...
... So we've got three guys dead. All Newcomers, all killed the same way -- execution style.
What was that about?
Thank you.
It's all right, George. It's cool. Just wait here, all right? I'll be back in a coupla minutes.
Stop the car!
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
Please, I must get out here.
Stop the car.
Come on, let's go, dude. Surf's up!
To the... to the beach?
Well, let's roll, George.
She's very progressive. I'm certain she's considering it.
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
She's going to divorce me.
A man, a human, was wiring it to your car. I didn't get a good look at him. I must call my wife...
Where'd you get this?!!
Yeah, go home. Get some sleep. You do sleep, don't you?
I'm going home.
Don't count on me, George. I never had any ideals.
No shit, Holmes. You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.
Ta ss'trakyona'...
Your health...
In the other man's rectum.
Maybe not... I don't know. I'm not sure I'm gonna go. She doesn't need her burn-out of a father there...
Human children can be very beautiful. Getting married? Congratulations. You will be taking Sunday off, then...
I appreciate your honesty, George.
Your home is quite disordered. I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in.
It's like having an eleventh finger removed. It hurts like hell, but you never really needed the damn thing in the first place.
We mate for life. Divorce... is a strange concept to us.
Was. Divorced.
You are married?
Yeah... I know the routine.
My wife? She worries about me.
So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?
I believe he is probably lying.
When will Strader return?
We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch.
Todd Watson. The assistant manager.
Who is he?
Yeah, that's it. Say it slow.
Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.
And what was that one about my mother? That was a good one.
Ss'loka'. It means literally "small but intelligent creature". It loses much in the translation.
So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?
Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked.
I'll bet. Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?
This is mole. It's good.
Which one is that? Raw what?
Three months. We learn quickly. We adapt. It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.
I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit. How long did it take you to learn English?
Yeah, sure. I knew that...
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
From quarantine, when my people first arrived here. He and I were housed together.
You know that guy?
Stay back! I'm okay.
Matthew, you don't have to-- .
Your mother mates out of season.
Tell me.
Screw me? That can't be right.
Screw you.
I'll handle it.
But I-- .
Back off, George.
Uh, Matthew...
Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?
At the end of the bar.
Who said that?
Why'd I do what?
Why did you do it?
We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, Warren Hubley.
Rudyard Kipling? No shit? Listen, we just need a minute of your time...
He has not been home since that day. But she told me where to find him.
Did you talk to him?
She didn't know him. But she said her son might.
Aw-right. What about the other guy?
Did you learn anything?
Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.
Why the hell--?! Great, fine. You talk to the wife.
I believe I should interview the widow alone.
A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.
How the hell do you know that?
Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.
And still it fits?
Well... Yeah, it's rubber. It stretches.
And that fits?
Get the picture?
What is this?
Shouldn't we examine their personal effects?
What's this? What's going on?
Great. Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
Well... yes, quite possibly.
Nothing's wrong. I just want to get something straight. You agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related, right?
What is wrong?
Look, you want to fit in here, right? You want to learn how to get along?
The murder at the mini-mart is not our case. The Captain said--
There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
Terrific. A real pillar of the community. Was Hubley missing anything when they found him? Was he ripped off?
Nice signal, dickwad!
Through the chest. Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
Let's talk Hubley.
Anyway, what's it matter to you if we think it's funny, right? Whatta you care?
Gesundheit. You don't mind if I stick to George, do you?
My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.
I am George.
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
No... two.
Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder. Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
Only holds five.
Casull .454 Magnum. You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
What is it?
You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find... Well, this is it.
... They took the stuff out, all of it -- this afternoon.
Yes it is. Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there. I don't know how these fellas do it.
That where Anderson worked?
I think you're gonna find he's taken the rest of his life off.
Wait. You know who it looks like? Yeah. Anderson. Uh... James Anderson. He isn't in today. He took the afternoon off.
Who else can I ask around here?
To be honest, it's hard to say. I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
We think he could'a been involved, yeah. You know him?
You think this is the guy who did it?
Well, one of the men didn't like him so much...
Sure. Just a minute.
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?
I'm sorry, Matt. Nothing here seems to be matching up...
Yeah -- we met him. Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
For you, anything.
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
That's all I know. You want anything more, you ask somebody else.
Yeah, I heard of it.
Yeah... I seen him around. High- roller dude named Strader. Joshua Strader. Runs a club on the west side. Encounters.
One of the two men was Hubley, right? What about the other one? Did you know him?
What's that?
Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already? Let's try again-- Is your name Porter?
Did he find anything?
Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.
What kind of test?
You mean the Blob? They're finishing up now.
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?
Yeah, I'll bet.
That's the way these people are. You don't hit both pumps you just piss them off.
Lucky nothing. I had to empty my damn gun into him.
Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
You took this gut out, too, didn't you?
Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.
The human?
Yeah, right. Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--
Come on. You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours.
You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...
Don't tell me what to think.
Granger and Pitts are already on it.
Departmental policy.
You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death. You know that. Leave that for Fedorchuk.
Captain. I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.
Yeah, Sykes?
I'll cover you! Get outta there!!
I can't! Do you mind!
Get outta there!
I got him. Don't get pinned.
Watch the driver. I'm going for a better angle on the door.
Yeah, that's comforting. Mine, too.
Of course. Right in the trunk of the car.
You got your vest?
Whatever gave you that idea?
Does that look at all suspicious to you?
Shit, if Kristin had to get married where I could afford it, we'd be holding the reception at Buddy's Burgers.
But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay? But--
How can I go?
It is.
Hope their plumbing's the same.
Uh, seems to be in front and behind.
Talk to me, Hudson.
Can't lock up...
Rescue mission. There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.
Hey, 'Top.' What's the op?
Let's go...let's go. Cycle through!
Whoooah! No shit? I'm impressed.
Would you, Sir?
Christ. I never saw such a buncha old women. You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?
This floor's freezing.
Say again? All after incinerators?
Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over.
Let's go. Pull 'em out.
Flame-units only. I want rifles slung.
Vasquez, take point. Let's move.
First squad up, on line. Hicks, get yours in a cordon. Watch the rear.
Ten seconds, people. Look sharp!
Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast. Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.
Awright! I want a nice clean dispersal this time.
Okay, let's do it.
Awright. Fire-team A. Gear up. Let's move. Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.
...that's better. Pan it around a bit.
Well, thanks, I --
You did okay, Bishop.
In seventeen minutes this place will be a cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska.
She's alive. They brought her here and you know it.
WE'RE NOT LEAVING!
PLENTY! TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
HOW MUCH TIME?
See you soon.
It's going to be closer. You better get going.
All right. Let's get on it. What'll you need?
I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to. I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
I'll go.
I'm afraid so. The crash did too much damage. The overload is inevitable, at this point.
And it's too late to shut it down?
I'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours. The blast radius will be about thirty kilometers. About equal to ten megatons.
How long until it blows?
That's it. See it? Emergency venting.
Could it be intelligent?
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
Yes. That follows.
Which would mean lots of those parasites, right? One for each person...over a hundred at least.
Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...
I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis. It seems to be metabolizing. He should wake up soon.
Sorry to disappoint you.
I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.
You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?
You sent them to that ship. I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.
Now, wait a second --
You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.
Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division. Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes. Set up for life.
This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command. Right?
Corporal Hicks!?
What rank? I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
You son of a bitch.
This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
They can bill me. I got a tab running. What's second?
Why not?
Now hold on a second. I'm not authorizing that action.
She's right.
That's not what I mean. Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
Yeah? Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
They're right under the primary heat exchangers.
Uh-hunh. One of thirty or so, all over the planet. They're completely automated. We manufacture them, by the way.
That the atmosphere processor?
I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.
I hope you're right. I really do.
Well, it didn't occur to me. It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
You never said anything about an android being here! Why not?
That's the plan. My word on it.
Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them. Not study. Not bring back. Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
Yello? Oh, Ripley. Hi...
No! The answer is no. Now please go. I'm sorry. Just go, would you.
Yes, and I've read it. You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...
Spare me, Burke. I've had my psych evaluation this month.
If I go.
What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
It's all I could get. Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything. Days off are worse.
Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
That's right.
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
Yeah, yeah. I saw the commercial.
Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights. We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'
What about you? What's your interest in this?
I was reamed, steamed and dry-cleaned by you guys...and now you want me to go back out there? Forget it.
Hear me out...
No. There's no way!
You are a head case. Have a donut.
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo.
Just tell them what happened. The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.
I get the picture.
You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.
Cancer. Hmmmm. They still haven't licked that one. Cremated. Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin. No children.
Amanda Ripley-McClaren. Married name, I guess. Age: sixty-six ...at time of death. Two years ago. I'm sorry.
Is she...?
Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...
Have they located my daughter yet?
You'd drifted right through the core systems. It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?
Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...
Shit. Apone, collect magazines from everybody. We can't have any firing in there.
We're talking thermonuclear explosion.
PDT'S. Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
What's he scanning for?
It's insured.
Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.
Dead on all channels.
Still nothing from the colony?
We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
You wouldn't be going in with the troops. I can guarantee your safety.
Forget it.
All right, I guess. One hell of a hangover. Look, Ripley... I...
How do you feel?
They're but off! Do something!
I told them to fall back...
Shut up. Just shut up!
GET THEM OUT OF THERE! DO IT NOW!
So? So?
So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
Proceed inside.
I don't know.
What is it?
Gorman! Give it a rest would you.
Where are your parents? You have to try...
Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?
One of us?
The structure seems intact. They have power.
Hold at forty. Slow circle of the complex.
How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?
You tell me. I only work here.
We're not making that out too well. What is it?
Unknown. But, it looks like all of them. Over at the processing station...sublevel 'C' under the south tower.
Hah! Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen! Found 'em.
Okay, stand by in operations. Let's go.
Sir, the CPU is on-line.
He's coming in. I feel safer already.
...We're coming in.
How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
Are there any questions? Hudson?
All we know is that there's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved.
Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
What's the question?
Hudson, Sir. He's Hicks.
Yes, Hicks?
At ease. I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...
Fuckin' A!
Let's go! Let's go!
Six meters. Five. What the fu --
Well you're not reading it right!
Let's get these things lit.
Seventeen meters.
Do it!
The corner! Ready?
Maybe we got 'em demoralized.
I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
We got problems.
Outstanding. Then all we need's a deck of cards. All right, let's move like we got a purpose.
Are you finished? You okay?
Well that's great! That's just fucking great, man. Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now!
Not that tunnel, the other one!
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Sure, Hicks.
Save it.
Don't be long, Ellen.
We ain't going anywhere.
Hicks, don't let him leave.
All right! She's alive. I believe it. But we gotta get moving! Now!
No! No! She's alive! We have to --
Stand back.
We didn't miss anything.
They learned. They cut the power and avoided the guns. They must have found another way in, something we missed.
Get back here, both of you. Fall back to Operations.
It's game time.
Let's waste him. No offense.
You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse. You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.
Wait a minute. We'd know about it.
Yeah. I've noticed.
Look, you started this. Now show me everything. I can handle myself.
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
What's this?
Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others. You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
Maybe. Maybe not.
They'll get us.
But they don't know that. They're probably looking for other ways to get in. That'll take them awhile.
Newt time then can walk right up and knock.
Can't tell. Lots. D gun's down to twenty. Ten. It's out.
Now many?
On my way.
They're in the approach corridor.
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
About seventeen days.
How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?
Poor bastard.
Removed surgically before embryo implantation. Subject: Marachuk, John L. Died during procedure. They killed him getting it off.
No. No! It ain't you. They're inside. Inside the perimeter. They're in here.
You're just reading me.
It's inside the complex.
Hudson, give us a break.
Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got out asses kicked, pal!
Yeah, bullshit. Watch us.
Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?
All right, we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of CN-20 down there. Nerve gas the whole nest?
Anytime. Anywhere.
Fuck you.
Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.
No. Have you?
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?
It's readin' right. Look!
Can't be. That's inside the room!
Nine meters. Eight.
They're right on us. Vasquez, how you doing?
Twelve meters. Man, this is a big fucking signal. Ten meters.
I don't know, an acid hole in a duct. Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know!
Fifteen meters.
Seal the door.
Range twenty meters.
Just get back here!
This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place...
What do you mean, they cut the power? How could they cut the power, man? They're animals.
They cut the power.
Oh, right! Right! With those things running around. No way.
Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there. Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.
What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end. Why can't we use that?
Think of what? We're fucked.
I don't care how! Think of a way. Think of something.
How? The transmitter was on the APC. It's wasted.
We need the other drop-ship. The on one the Sulaco. We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.
Uh, what's next?
Yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here.
This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.
She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.
Oh, God. Jesus. This ain't happening.
You can't help them. Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
Hey...hey! Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
Looks like it stung him.
The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours. Gestating. Then it... ...then it...emerges. Moults. Grows rapidly --
Sounds like you, Hicks.
Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
So what do I tell this guy?
There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team. Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
Yeah. What?
You remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau, out past the Ilium range, a couple days ago?
No.. I've slept enough.
Bad dreams again? Do you want something to help you sleep?
Just a couple of days. Do you feel up to a visitor?
How long have I been on Gateway station?
Just terrible? That's better than yesterday at least.
And how are we today?
Yes, honey. I think we both can.
Can we dream?
That's right.
Are we going to sleep now?
Right here, baby. Right here.
Newt, I want you to hang on, now. Hang on tight.
I knew you'd come.
Newt, wait!
This way. Come on, we're almost there!
Sure. Go left.
DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
Come on. Crawl faster.
Burke! Open the door!
I know, honey. Me too.
Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared.
Sssh. Don't move. We're in trouble.
Wah...? Where are...?
Newt. Newt, wake up.
I'll be right in the other room, Newt. And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
Don't go! Please.
You mean dead.
Where is she?
Yes. A little girl.
Did you ever have a baby?
No, it's different, honey.
Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
I don't know, Newt. That's the truth.
Did one of those things grow inside her?
Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.
Why do they tell little kids that?
Yes, there are, aren't there.
My mommy always said there were no monsters. No real ones. But there are.
Oh. Sorry, Newt.
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
I don't want to...I have scary dreams.
Now you just lie here and have a nap. You're exhausted.
You don't have to be sorry. It wasn't your fault.
I'm sorry, Newt.
I guess we're not leaving, right?
You're really something, ace.
Yeah, you know. In the walls, under the floor. I was the ace. I could hide better than anybody.
The 'maze'? You mean the air ducts?
I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze.
And hope to die?
Cross my heart.
You promise?
Newt. Look at me...Newt. I won't leave you. I promise.
They're dead.
They'd be here if they could, honey. I know they would.
Because you'll be gone soon, like the others. Like everybody. You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone.
Why not?
I don't want you for a friend.
What about me?
Casey. She's my only friend.
Newt. My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
What did you say?
Sweet Jesus.
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
How many colonists?
What are you talking about. What people?
Why won't you check out LV-426?
...because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew, within twelve hours of hatching...
Thank you, Officer Ripley. That will be...
That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock! Like I said.
The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe...
It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.
Look, I told you...
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
What do you mean?
His Grace is very angry with you.
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?
Follow me, please. The Archbishop would like a word.
Meaning you didn't like it.
Extremely clever.
What did you think of the music?
You were sublime.
How was I? Tell me honestly.
Nothing! He can marry who he pleases. I don't give a damn.
Well, what does it matter to you?
The marriage!
Did you know? Had you heard?
Looks don't concern me, Maestro. Only talent interests a woman of taste.
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
You might be disappointed.
What does he look like?
Oh. Well perhaps you could introduce us anyway.
My dear, it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna as a singing prostitute for a Turk.
Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.
A Turkish brothel.
A brothel.
What's that?
In a harem.
Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
Why not?
Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.
How do you know?
Is there a part for me?
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
Good morning.
Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore.
No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?
I assume she's the virtuoso in that department. There can't be any other reason you'd marry someone like that.
Is she a good fuck?
I'm so relieved.
No, she's fine.
Is her mother still lying on the floor?
Oh - excuse me!
I'll be right back.
Don't bother.
Don't bother!
Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you!
You have leave to try.
Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
And how will you make him keep it?
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
Sir -
But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
No! I won't have him back.
Then try harder, Mozart. I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain in my service and learn your place. Go now.
No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.
I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.
If His Grace is not satisfied with me, he can dismiss me.
How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you, the more you take.
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
Why what, sir?
Oh shut up. I'm sick to death of that tune.
Are you drunk? You invited me. And my horse. Here he is. Ottavio!
Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.
I've come to dinnnnnner!
Who the devil are you? What do you want?
Don Giovannnnnnnni!
What are you talking about?
I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
I want to go back to Vienna.
I want to go!
What is it?
Go back to bed.
It's killing me.
Why not?
I can't write it!
Give me one reason I can understand.
Give me two more weeks. Please.
Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't I?
No. Don't answer it!
You'd think I was mad.
Why not?
I'm not telling you.
What's that? Oh! Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi, who gave you this?
I heard voices.
No one.
Who was that?
Shut up! I'll not let you put anything in my hand until I see some money.
Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
Oh, Stanzi.
When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
Why not? Half the house!
You're not going to do this?
I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?
Half the receipts! Stanzi!
Your father is dead.
Wolfi! Your father is dead.
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
Yes, my love?
We'll have a little party. Come in. Come in. You know Herr Schikaneder? This is! a very nice girl.
No, it's right he should hear. I'm sick to death of it. We can't do anything right for you, can we?
Oh, damn!
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
Well, ask her!
I don't know.
What does she want?
There's a young girl to see you.
Wolfi, I think your father's tired. I'll cook us something here.
What? How can you be so boring? Tea!
Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?
May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?
He's not Herr Mozart. Call him Papa.
Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
My Stanzi - look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Come on now, confess, Papa. Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter?
I love you! I love you!
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
Tell them to go!
What's the matter with you?
Tell them to go away. I don't want to see anybody.
Stop it now. Stop it. I've brought some friends to meet you. They're next door waiting. Do we have anything to eat? They're all starving.
This isn't pride. It's sheer stupidity!
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
Don't be stupid.
How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?
Well, don't do that again!
You borrowed money from your mother?
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
Oh yes? You always know everything.
No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.
They'll come anyway. They love me here.
One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!
Oh, leave me alone.
I think you're mad! You're really mad!
Of course.
Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling very well. Can we leave now?
Eat my - ah!
Tish-I'm tee. What's that?
Tub - but i-tub - but I vol - love but I love ui - You. I love you!
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram! Em iram!
No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
No, I'm not playing this game.
Em iram! Em iram!
Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!
No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!
Yes, you are. You're very sick.
Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
Oh, ha, ha, ha.
Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.
Do you think that's funny?
Why? People fart backwards.
That's stupid.
Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
Why not?
Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man.
We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.
Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
No! No! No!
I am! I am! I'm stopping it - slowly. You see! Look, I've stopped. Now we are going back.
Stop it!
Madame, I will respect his. He asked me to stay here.
I regret we have no servants to show you out, Herr Salieri. Respect my wish and go.
He's not going to work on this anymore. It is making him ill. Please.
No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
This is not his handwriting.
And I'm asking you -
He asked me to stay.
No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
He needs me, ma'am.
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
I was at hand.
Why you?
Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
What are you doing here?
I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go?
Then don't. It's up to you. Not to be vague, that is the price.
But! I'm a married woman!
It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.
Isn't it obvious?
What do you mean?
Some service deserves service in return. No?
What for?
Come back tonight.
Oh, thank you, sir!
Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his.
Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.
It is miraculous.
Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
These are originals?
That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like.
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
I see.
No, sir. This is my own idea.
Then he didn't send you?
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest.
I understand.
He's terribly busy, sir.
How charming. But why did he not come himself?
Frau Mozart?
Madame. How can I help you?
Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor. Who are you?
You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
Money! Money!
Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!
I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
He's doing his best.
I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
Leave him alone!
Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?
I hope so. I need it immediately.
He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
Where's our friend?
Not at all.
Am I interrupting something?
Ah. Well. Ah, I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about half the receipts?
How much will you pay him?
Do you hear him? Do you?
So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.
Well, this is none of your business. Whoever sent you is going to pay, no?
But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.
In three months! Papa.
When, may I ask?
Oh, yes.
I see that you're expecting.
He's adorable!
Be careful!
Be careful!
Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!
I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.
Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart immediately! This is insupportable!
I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
Do you know who I am? This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.
Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor.
Yes. He is a little strange.
What a strange young man.
I said play!
Michael, please! I'm sure you will find her most willing, Herr Mozart. She's really very excited. She's been preparing all morning.
People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
I've heard about you for ages! I thought you must be an old man.
You can't be Herr Mozart!
Thank you, Madame. Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
Who was your teacher?
Just one year.
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?
Ah, now! Here she comes.
Well, look at them.
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
Do you like this, Salieri?
Molested, Majesty. Twice, in the course of the same lesson.
As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
Of course not.
Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.
Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.
Why not?
Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.
I don't think you understand me, Court Composer.
Well. There it is.
You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
And the result satisfies.
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!
Your Highness.
Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth.
Cattivo again, Court Composer. Well, tell him, Mozart. Name us a German virtue.
Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.
Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
My pleasure.
Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!
And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.
A-flat, Majesty.
Let's have some fun. Bring in Herr Mozart, please. But slowly, slowly. I need a minute to practice.
You do me too much honour, Sire.
Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?
May I try it?
It's just a trifle, of course.
What a charming idea. May I see?
You are cattivo, Court Composer. I want to meet this young man. Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him.
Sire, the whole opera is finished. Do you know how much work went into it?
You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not.
Twenty, sire! How about twenty? Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives.
Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
I have no idea.
Ah, love again.
But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.
Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.
Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
Would you tell me why?
Well, yes, I admit it is.
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
Who told you this, Majesty?
Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?
Yes, Sire.
Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?
Ah! By all means.
What is it?
Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?
Thank you, Sire!
Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.
Well, my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in Vienna.
Excuse me, but how old are you?
Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether.
Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?
Enchanted, Madame.
Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.
Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?
I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less.
Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say? How shall one say, Director?
What do you mean, Sire?
Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!
And German?
Yes, indeed.
It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?
I think so, Sire, yes.
What? On one hearing only?
Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is already here in my head.
In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
Yes, where?
It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the whole thing is set in a - in a -
Well, what is it about? Tell us the story.
Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!
Why so?
Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.
Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely.
The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
Oh, thank you.
Your Majesty!
Ah-ha. Well. There it is. Good.
He's here.
Yes, what about him?
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
Well, what do you have for me today?
Well. There it is.
Yes, sir.
In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. Plain German. For plain people.
Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?
Very small pay, I imagine. I'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer. Say, an opera in German for our National Theatre.
I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?
Father -
She does. She says I sleep all day.
No one calls you that.
Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!
I never saw this girl in my life. Is this a kind of joke?
Are you playing a trick on me?
Papa, is this your idea?
But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.
I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!
This is just a game, Papa.
No, really!
Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa!
Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me.
Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did.
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.
It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is!
You don't have secrets from me.
It's a secret.
Why not?
Oh, let's not talk about it.
What's that?
This one will.
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
How many?
How many pupils do you have?
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
They say you're in debt.
What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
That's not what I hear.
It couldn't be better.
How is your financial situation?
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
Don't you have a maid?
She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.
Do you always live like this?
I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi!
Is she not here?
Of course, welcome! Welcome ten thousand times. Papa! my Papa!
Am I not welcome?
Why are you here?
I will.
Are you sure it's an opera?
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
Opera? Opera!
I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
Is he working?
Is he working?
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
I don't know. He has pains.
What medicine?
You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
Why? What has happened?
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?
In there, sir.
Where does he work?
Yes what?
I think I've found out about the money, sir.
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
Really? What is it he's writing?
Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
Not that I've seen.
Do any pupils come to the house?
Oh, thank you, sir.
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.
Bene! Bene!
Yes, thank you, sir.
Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?
I will, sir.
Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker.
What have you got for me today? Let me see.
Good morning, sir.
Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.
Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.
Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?
They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
That's right.
Are you Herr Mozart?
So let me see it. Where is it?
Well, we can.
Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.
Because there's nothing to see.
Why not?
Can I see it?
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
What is this?
Put it down!
Leave that alone!
So there you are. What do you say?
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
I liked the horse.
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
Wonderful! He liked the monkey, didn't you?
That kind of music should be punishable by death.
Sublime! Utterly sublime!
Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room.
What did he say? What did he say?
Sssh! Stay here.
My answer is no, Mozart.
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
I'm sorry. No.
No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours.
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
What for?
Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?
What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?
Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?
It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!
Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose. How long have you been playing, Fraulein?
Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?
Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.
Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.
Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?
I'm afraid I am.
This is Herr Mozart, my dear. The young man Herr Salieri recommended to teach our Gertrude. Where is she?
You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.
What? Ha-ha! That's funny - I like it. Which one, eh? You're a funny fellow. Hannah! Come this way.
And which one of them do you want me to teach?
I was foolish. I thought you did not care for my work - or me. Forgive me. Forgive me!
What for?
I am so ashamed.
I'm not leaving you.
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
Do you want to rest a bit?
Then let me hear it. All of it. The whole thing from the beginning - now!
Do you have it?
You go fast!
And that's it. Do you have it?
Yes, and on 'dictis'.
Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above. Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis.
That's wonderful!
Show me.
I think so.
Do you have me?
Oh no. Now for the Fire. Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.
And that's all?
Exactly. The instruments to go with the voices. Trumpets and timpani, tonic and dominant.
Also identical?
With the tenors.
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
It couldn't be simpler.
Please! Just one moment.
Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm. The first bassoon and tenor trombone -
Fourth measure, second beat - F. Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis, flam- mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.
Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C. Con-fu-ta-tis. Second measure, fourth beat on D. Ma-le-dic-tis. All right?
Sing it back.
I think so.
Start with the voices. Basses first. Second beat of the first measure - A. Con-fu-ta-tis. Second measure, second beat. Ma-le-dic-tis. G-sharp, of course.
Common time.
What time?
The Fire.
So now - A minor. Suddenly.
We ended in F Major?
Confutatis Maledictis.
Come. Let's begin.
Oh, yes.
A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
Do you believe in it?
Consigned to flames of woe.
So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
Where did I stop?
A Mass. A Mass for the Dead.
Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
Of course.
But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.
Would you? Actually, you could.
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?
He knows. He knows!
Finish what?
Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it.
What man?
The man. He's here.
No! No, it's him!
Shall I answer it?
I'm too young to be so sick.
The doctor thinks I am. But -
Are you ill?
I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things.
I do.
Do you mean that?
Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.
This is only a vaudeville.
I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that.
I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did.
No, please.
You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
You mean she's not coming back?
Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.
Where is your wife?
No, no. I have to get back. I have -
I'm taking you home. You're not well.
What happened? Is it over?
No, no! I promise you, I'll give you a wonderful piece - the best I ever can!
Are you neglecting my request?
I don't have it yet. It's not finished. I'm sorry, but I need more time.
Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.
How long will you give me?
How much?
I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.
Who are you?
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
What dead? Who is dead?
A Mass for the dead.
What work?
I have come to commission work from you.
Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri!
You flatter me.
I never knew that music like that was possible.
How could it not, Excellency?
Did my work please you?
How could I not?
Mozart. It was good of you to come.
Grazie, a lei, Signor Antonio!
Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?
I think it's marvelous. Truly.
What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
But what is it they don't like?
I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.
Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.
Thank you! Oh, thank you.
With all my heart, Mozart.
Oh, Excellency, would you?
But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
How fortunate.
Oh no! My wife took it out in time.
You burned the score?
Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
Really? Why?
It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.
Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter?
I can't say. Really
What exactly are you working on?
Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?
Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.
Ah. Italian?
Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.
Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.
I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.
Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.
I'm afraid not.
Do you have a daughter?
Of course not.
How is that possible? You give concerts, don't you? I hear they are quite successful.
How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!
It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.
No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage.
An implausible idea. Between you and me, no one in the world could do musical harm to the Princess Elizabeth.
No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.
Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.
Herr Sommer.
Whom did they choose?
My dear Mozart, there is no one in the world I would rather help, but now it is too late.
Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please!
I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.
Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?
Why didn't you come to me yesterday, Mozart? This is a most painful situation. Yesterday I could have helped you. Today, I can't.
So you see, this post is very important to me right now.
I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
So you are. How is your pretty wife?
Herr Mozart, what brings you here?
It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?
How could I not?
Did you like it, then?
Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.
But this is absurd!
Yes! yes! er, on the whole, yes, Majesty.
Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.
Love, Sire!
A funny little tune, but it yielded some good things.
Mio caro Adone.
I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?
Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
Can we see the scene with the music back, please?
Taking out what you should never have put in.
What are you doing, Herr Director?
It is dangerous for you to interpret His Majesty's edicts. Give me your score, please.
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
Exactly. A dance.
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
Certainly, Herr Director.
Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please. Right away.
Just let me tell you how it begins.
That will do, Herr Mozart!
But, Your Majesty -
What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts.
Well not especially. It can be in Turkish, if you really want. I don't care.
Then why especially does it have to be in German?
You mean in Turkey?
I think you'd better.
I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately.
Oh? Have I seen it?
May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?
Herr Mozart -
Must I? Well, I won't! I tell you straight: I will not!
Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
Mozart -
Mozart -
Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
Who is on this committee?
A little modesty would suit you better.
No, but I'm the best.
Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
On the contrary.
Is the Emperor angry with me?
Because His Majesty wishes it.
Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.
What is what?
What is this, Herr Chamberlain?
Mozart -
Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine.
My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?
Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.
I don't think it was really decided, Director.
Oh my son, my poor son!
My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?
What difference does that make?
But not his body.
I poisoned his life.
No, you didn't!
I did.
Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him.
Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Always the same stale answers! There is no God of Mercy, Father. Just a God of torture.
I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
My son, no one can speak for God.
No? Was Mozart a good man?
You cannot say that!
Every day. Sometimes for hours I would pray!
Did you try?
He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.
Do you hear me?
Should I?
Do you believe it?
Is it true?
And do they believe it?
All Vienna has heard that.
Ah - you've heard that?
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
Oh, I know that! That's charming! I didn't know you wrote that.
I regret it is not too familiar.
I'm surprised you don't know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it. How about this?
I can't say I do. What is it?
Then you must know this.
Here in Vienna.
I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
How well are you trained in music?
My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.
I do not seek forgiveness.
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
Are they?
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
Leave me alone.
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
What do you want?
In the sight of God that is a sin.
You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
About what?
I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.
What do you want?
Yes, in the third act.
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
Ballet? What ballet?
About the ballet.
What anger?
The Emperor has given him permission.
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
Never mind.
I've seen the manuscript.
Are you absolutely sure?
You must be mad.
He's setting that play to music?
You mean that play?
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.
Oh yes, yes. And that was?
For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director?
Did we?
Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.
Well done, Sire!
Bravo, Your Majesty!
WOMAN +++$+++ Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.
Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?
WOMAN +++$+++ Of course now. Right away, before I get any older.
What do you mean - now?
WOMAN +++$+++ Well, promise then.
I can't wait.
Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
WOMAN +++$+++ I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
What? Who the devil are you?
WOMAN +++$+++ Here I am, my angel.
How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.
I agree, Baron.
This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop.
Come with me. And stay in the room.
He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
What does he want?
Show her in. Then go to bed.
That lady is back, sir.
Excuse me, my dear.
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
Who is she?
Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly!
Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh?
Yes. And congratulations to all of you. It was superb.
I'll call tomorrow.
And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.
Of course.
Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
But he's all right?
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
Can we come in?
Yes, I am looking after him.
Herr Salieri.
Thank you.
I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.
You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
How did he look?
The American? Yes, duck.
Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?
I doubt it. But it's something to do.
Nurse Hobbs said there's a disturbance in Leicester Square involving some sort of mad dog.
Tea would be nice.
What shall we do?
I expect you shortly.
No, a cab will be faster.
Shall I send a car?
He's fine. We'll come right over.
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
Yes, Doctor.
Yes, I should think so.
Could you get here without any trouble?
No, not really.
Is David acting strangely?
No, why?
Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
The zoo? Is he rational?
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
He's here.
Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.
What shall we do?
Dr. Hirsch?
Surely you're not suggesting...
No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.
You've absolutely no idea where David might be?
I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf.
And what else?
They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
Warn him?
David says Jack comes to warn him.
What did he say?
Has his friend appeared to him again?
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
He's not?
At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
It's a full moon. Where is he?
Yes, sir.
Oh dear girl, your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me. I don't give a damn who you sleep with. I'm concerned about David.
Come to my office, Miss Price.
It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.
Yes, I believe he did.
Did he say a wolf?
No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor.
What happened to them?
That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
He said 'Jack'.
What exactly did he call out?
Yes, Doctor?
Oh, Miss Price?
Yes, Doctor.
Go about your duties.
Dr. Hirsch?
Can I be of service, Miss Price?
Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital.
Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago.
Control!?! What control!?! Get away from me!
David, don't lose control.
Leave me alone, dammit! You people are crazy! I've got to get away from here! I've got to do something!
David, let's go now.
Hopeless. It's hopeless.
Will you shut up!?!!
Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and...
I swear, I don't know this girl.
We had an argument. He's being silly.
He's playing a stupid joke, sir.
Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!
David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.
Jack is dead. Look, six people have been killed. I'm going to the police.
Jack is dead!
I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I...
David, stop!
Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
David, what are you doing?
Pull over.
I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
I should be committed.
The next corner we can get a cab.
Don't you remember?
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
The zoo?
Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!
I'm freezing.
David! Where on earth have you been!?!
See you later.
I'm off. There's food in the fridge.
A doper werewolf.
I've left those pills for you.
Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?
Yeah, I do, but go to work.
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
Werewolves simply do not exist.
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
Do me an enormous favor?
Let me go now, you'll make me late.
That's good, Alex. Reassure me.
Tomorrow is the full moon.
I wasn't hallucinating.
But, David.
I was awake and he was in my room.
David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?
Of course.
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
It's nice to see you.
It's nice to see you.
David, perhaps you'd like to watch the telly while I take a shower.
There is only one bed.
The bedroom.
Very nice.
The kitchen.
Yeah, I would think so, too.
I would think so.
I was dreaming again?
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
Your dead friend Jack?
My friend Jack was just here.
You're to be discharged tomorrow. Will you be all right?
I'll let you know the next full moon.
Are you better now?
A werewolf?
I'm a werewolf.
Good. I thought for a moment I was the only embarrassed one in the room.
Now I'm embarrassed.
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.
You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
Not just a patient -- me.
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
Will you think about it?
Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.
I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
Will you come with me?
David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.
I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.
That's easy enough.
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Hello. You all right?
Yes, go on.
What? Oh, yes, please.
Shall I read to you?
My best friend. My very best friend.
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
Now what do you want to talk about?
I know.
I'm twenty-seven.
How old are you?
That's not really a very proper question.
How old are you?
It's okay. I want to talk to you.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
I dream of death mostly.
What do you dream about?
I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.
Do you like it?
'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
I was. What are you reading?
I thought you were asleep.
You're a very beautiful girl.
Will you give me a break?
Let's try a little harder, shall we?
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
Call me David.
Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler?
Aw come on, Alex!
Call me Alex.
Aw come on, Miss Price!
Leave the pills. I'll take them later.
How is that?
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
Please, really. I'm not hungry.
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
I'm not very hungry, thank you.
You haven't eaten your lunch.
Mr. Kessler?
A wolf.
It was a wolf.
I beg your pardon?
It wasn't a lunatic.
I thought not.
Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?
No what?
How are we feeling tonight?
The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.
Feeling better?
Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
No what?
Hello, Benjamin.
Really, Susan, I don't think that was very proper, and besides, it's common practice now.
I looked.
Why on earth do you say that?
I think he's a Jew.
Chart says he's from New York.
He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him.
Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
He all right?
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
Has he been refusing food?
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
Miss Price.
That's what I want you to do, you moron!
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
Who is this girl?
Shakespeare was French! The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell! Shit! Fuck! Piss!
Now see here young man.
Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!
There's no call for that kind of language.
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
All right, you two, move along.
You did, did you?
Officer, I killed those people last night.
Why are you doing this to me?
No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.
That's easy for you to say - you're already dead.
Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
Why are you doing this to me, Jack?
You could have told them!
No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!
That's very funny, that is.
Oh, all right. There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York. It was full of men from the United Nations.
No. You've had your chance.
Oh, come on, tell us.
All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.
Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!
You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.
No, but we're about to.
Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?
Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
Some, everyone does.
Do you have bad dreams, too?
What are you going to see?
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.
What time is it?
Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning.
I was having a nightmare.
Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.
Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
Dr. Hirsch? I'd rather not be by myself.
You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
I really don't know.
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
Did you see Jack?
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?
Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.
You've never had bad dreams before?
Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity I'm beginning to worry about.
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
So they said.
There were witnesses?
Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now. Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now.
Two weeks?
You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.
How long have I been here?
Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
Miss Price! Miss Price, please!
Now, David, I want you to prepare yourself; your friend is dead.
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
You're in a hospital in London.
Where am I?
Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins.
If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death.
I could hang myself.
How shall I do it?
Because this must be stopped.
David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.
I want you to meet some people.
What about the zoo?
Thank you.
You look awful.
If I was still alive, I probably would.
Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
You don't have to say anything.
What can I say, Jack?
Hi, David.
Hi, Jack.
I will not accept this! Now go away!
What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit!
You must believe me.
I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
What do you think?
Jack, are you really dead?
You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.
A monster. I know, I know.
David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...
Get out of here, Jack!
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
I wanted to see you.
What are you doing here?
Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.
You're not real.
Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.
Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.
David, please believe me. You will kill people, David. You've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins.
You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
Jack, please go away. Please go away.
Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.
Stop it, Jack.
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
It's you, David.
Will you be quiet?!
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
What's wrong with you? Shut up!
I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
Shut up, you zombie!
On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.
I'm not listening!
We were attacked by a werewolf.
If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!
I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.
I'm going completely crazy.
Life mocks me even in death.
Rudy Levine the shmuck?
So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.
I can't stand it.
Debbie Klein cried a lot.
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.
David! You're hurting my feelings.
I'm aware that I don't look so great, but I thought you'd be glad to see me.
This is too much. I can't handle this.
Thanks a lot.
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
Nice to see you.
Are you going to help me up?
You really scared me, you shithead.
Well. I'm glad we... WHOAA!!
I'll tell you when we get there.
Where are we going?
Not far enough. Come on.
It sounds far away.
See anything?
Walking away, yes, sir. Here we are walking away.
Walk away, Jack.
Nice doggie. Good boy.
A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away.
Oh shit. What is that?
Do you think it's a dog?
It's in front of us.
Let's just keep walking.
What's the plan?
It's circling us.
It's moving.
Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving.
Come on, where?
I don't know. Come on.
Shit! David, what is that?
I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.
It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
No, but he was on the moors.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
Pecos Bill.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
There aren't any coyotes in England.
A coyote.
Could be a lot of things.
What was it?
I heard that.
Did you hear that?
I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you.
Say, David...
I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it, because they felt so silly.
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
I have no idea.
What do you think was wrong?
Well, not quite a blood-thirsty mob.
I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.
Come on, I'm freezing.
Beware the moon?
I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
What the hell was that all about?
Apparently so.
Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!
What do you mean? I'm starving.
Jack, we'd better go.
You ask them.
Go on, ask them.
I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
You ask them.
Ask them what the candles are for.
Maybe the owners are from Texas.
It's a five-pointed star.
What about it?
Look at that.
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
Nice looking group.
Nice to see you.
Shall we?
I assume full responsibility.
David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
That's not a spear. It's a pike.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
That's a wolf's head.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
The Slaughtered Lamb?
She says she 'likes me too much'.
We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.
I don't know.
Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
You're talking about the woman I love.
She's a jerk.
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
Well, I like it here.
Oh, I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place?
You're not having a good time are you?
Are you cold?
Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you.
What can we do to assist you?
Regardless of what you think, Lieutenant, the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him.
The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but I hardly think...
Why don't we ask him?
Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
You were saying?
Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?
No, thank you, Doctor.
Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea?
Dr. Hirsch?
Tell him I'm out. No, tell him I've passed away. An old war wound or something. Tell him I'm dead. And no more calls!
He's on the telephone.
What here?
Roger Mathison, Doctor.
Excuse me. Yes?
Send them in.
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
I see. You've heard nothing about the incident?
Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.
What's that?
I suppose Guinness will suffice.
Sorry, love.
Campari and soda would do nicely.
Hello, there. What can I get you?
I beg your pardon?
Remember the Alamo?
But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
Then you have some hot tea?
We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea.
Hot chocolate?
Do you have any hot soup?
We'll find him, not to worry.
I cannot accept a connection between David Kessler and last night's murders. We will find him, however. I can assure you of that.
That is precisely my point. David, as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed. We won't trouble you any further. Good day.
I don't rightly know, sir.
And what, Sergeant?
Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...
He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man.
Has Mr. Kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors?
I'd like some tea, please.
No, thank you.
Yeah - sure!
If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I?
Why not?
She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
What's the idea of turning her down? It sounds like a perfectly safe investment.
I want to know why .
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!
You here again? What do you want?
Hello, Tom.
He has?
The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office.
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
Where's Matt?
No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
No kidding?
I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
Oscar, what's the matter?
Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own.
And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.
I remember once when your account checked.
I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.
What's the matter, Charlie?
Where do you think I've been? I took the baby for a stroll in the park.
Where you been?
Aw, nerts!
Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?
It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
Whose death?
Baby, I can't give you anything but love...
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
Let me have ten bucks?
Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?
Here's twenty-five thousand.
It was more than that last week.
About twenty-four thousand.
How much?
Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls.
Yes, sir.
And tell him not to delay.
Yes, sir.
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
Not yet, Mr. Clark.
Mr. Dickson in yet?
You know Dickson as well as we do. He'll shut the doors before he gives up control.
Take it easy, Clark.
How are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans!
What good will that do?
Don't make me laugh, Schultz!
Oh, is he? We carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city. We're fools to tolerate it.
Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all right.
Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!
The bank. All right. Do anything you want with it.
Dickson, I'd like to talk to you about the bank.
So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you? Well, I'm not going to resign now - or ever.
Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.
I have everything I own in it. It's your bank as well as mine, isn't it?
That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
What do you mean, help?
We'll discuss that in the board room.
What about?
We want to talk to you.
Yes! You said it, Clark. That's the only thing that means anything to me.
I'm running this bank my way. Get that clear!
Most of the creditors I know personally. I've seen them grow up in the community. I knew their fathers and mothers before them.
Character, hmmpf! That's your idea?
Just pure luck!
Oh, you would, eh? All right. If it's more important than golf, go ahead. What's on your mind?
Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name.
Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
They took my keys yesterday. I went there to get them back.
What were you doing at Finlay's this morning?
Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you!
Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you.
All right, Jack, all right.
Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun.
Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming "Mother Machree."
Why, of course.
You understand?
If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.
Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.
That's very simple. I was home.
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett.
Get out, get out!
She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes.
You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!
Fifty thousand dollars!
Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!
What happened? You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.
Confessed! Cluett, in heaven's name, what got into you?
Listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty easy. Quit squawking!
But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?
All you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we'll do the rest, see?
What do you mean?
You don't have to do nothing.
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
Why not?
But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
That don't do us any good.
I haven't got it.
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!
You know what we do to welchers, Cluett, don't you?
What are you doing here?
Why, Matt!
I'll grow a moustache by the time you get out of here.
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
And now fair woman, I have you in my power.
